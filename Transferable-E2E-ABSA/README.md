# Introduction

**1) E2E-ABSA**: This task aims to jointly learn aspects as well as their sentiments from user reviews, whch can be effectively formulated as an end-to-end sequence labeling problem based on the unified tagging scheme.

The unified tagging is similar to the NER tagging.

**unified tag** = **aspect boundary tag** + **sentiment tag**

**NER tag** = **entity boundary tag** + **entity type tag**

As we all know, labeling sequence data behaves much more expensive and time-comsuming. 

**2) Transferable-E2E-ABSA**: we firstly explore an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) setting for cross-domain E2E-ABSA. Unlike the traditional UDA in classification problems, this task aims to leverage knowledge from a labeled source domain to improve the ***sequence learning*** in an unlabeled target domain.

### AD-SAL (full Model): 
selective adversairal learning on the low-level AD task.
```
python main.py --train --test -s rest -t service -model_name AD-SAL --selective
```

### AD-AL (ablation Model): 
pure adversairal learning without selectivity on the low-level AD task.
```
python main.py --train --test -s rest -t service -model_name AD-AL
```

### Training over all transfer pairs:
```
./scripts/train_AD-AL.sh
./scripts/train_AD-SAL.sh
```
