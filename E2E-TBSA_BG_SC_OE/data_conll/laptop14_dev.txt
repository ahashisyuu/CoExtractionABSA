as O
you O

other O
things O
to O
consider O
before O

PUNCT O

i O
love O
the O
way O
the O
entire O
suite B-POS
of I-POS

works O
together O
PUNCT O

pairing O

an O

is O
a O
pure O
pleasure O
PUNCT O

i O

PUNCT O

they O

that O
the O

of O

PUNCT O

amazing O
quality S-POS
PUNCT O

it O
does O

what O

PUNCT O

the O
genius O
at O

that O
there O
was O
nothing O

this O
failure O
PUNCT O

the O
apple O

24ghz O

is O
a O
horrible O
waste O
of O

PUNCT O

if O
you O
find O
yourself O
in O
the O

for O
a O
new O

and O
have O
the O

do O
n't O
exclude O
looking O
at O
the O

PUNCT O

those O
things O
are O
very O
important O
PUNCT O
vital O
even O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
now O
had O
it O
for O
15 O
months O
and O
love O
it O
PUNCT O

trying O
to O
balance O
all O
of O
my O
roles O
leaves O
very O
little O
time O
for O
me O
to O
do O
anything O
PUNCT O
so O
i O
want O
to O
manage O
my O
time O
i O
do O
have O
to O
be O
the O
most O
efficient O
PUNCT O

it O
would O
take O
up O
too O
much O
time O
to O
do O
reaearch O
for O
my O
papers O
and O
i O
would O
be O
up O
hours-just O
because O
the O
computer O
was O
too O
slow O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
returning O
mine O

it O
weighed S-NEU
like O
seven B-NEU

or O
something O
like O
that O
PUNCT O

with O
a O
healthy O
pessimism O
PUNCT O
i O
took O
the O
machine O
home O
and O
tried O
to O
find O
a O
flaw O
PUNCT O

and O
not O
to O
mention O
after O
using O
it O
for O
a O
few O
months O
or O
so O
PUNCT O
the O
battery S-NEG
will O
slowly O
less O
and O
less O
hold O
a O
charge O
until O
you O
ca O
n't O
leave O
it O
unplugged O
for O
more O
than O
5 O
minutes O
without O
the O
thing O
dying O
PUNCT O

it O
absolutely O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
most O
pc O

PUNCT O
but O
the O
ease O
of O
use S-POS
PUNCT O
security S-POS
PUNCT O
and O
minimal O
problems O
that O
have O
arisen O
make O
it O
well O
worth O
the O
pricetag O
PUNCT O

i O
wish O
the O
volume S-NEG
could O
be O
louder O
and O
the O
mouse S-NEG
did O
n't O
break O
after O
only O
a O
month O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
fact O
i O
do O
n't O
like O
about O
apples O
is O
they O
generally O
use O
safari S-NEG
and O
i O
do O
n't O
use O
safari S-NEG
but O
after O
i O
install O
mozzilla B-POS

i O
love O
every O

about O
it O
PUNCT O

great O

the O

the O

a O
bummer O
it O

PUNCT O

i O
love O
the O

PUNCT O

they O
sent O
out O
the O

right O
away O
for O
me O
to O
send O
in O
my O
computer O
PUNCT O
they O
paid O

PUNCT O
but O
when O
i O
got O
my O

back O
it O
still O
was O

and O
now O
my O

i O
bought O
this O

was O
the O
worst O

've O
ever O

PUNCT O

yeah O
PUNCT O
of O
course O
smarty O

fix O
it O
nowaspect1 O
PUNCT O
compared O
to O
the O
early O
2011 O
edition O
i O
did O
see O
inbuilt B-NEG
applications E-NEG
crashing O
and O
it O
prompted O
me O
to O
send O
the O
report O
to O
apple O
which O
i O
promptly O
did O
PUNCT O

summary O
PUNCT O
dont O
buy O
hp O
PUNCT O

i O
think O
part O
of O
the O
problem O
with O
this O
computer O
is O
vista S-NEG
PUNCT O
yet O
i O
know O
vista S-NEG
is O
n't O
the O
entire O
issue O
because O
my O
latest O
purchase O
was O
my O
acer O
and O
it O
also O
has O
vista S-NEG
i O
should O
have O
waited O
the O
few O
months O
to O
get O
the O
next O
operating B-NEU
system E-NEU
PUNCT O

that O
whole O
experience O
was O
just O
ridiculous O
we O
sent O
it O
in O
and O
after O
they O
told O
us O
that O
we O
had O
to O
pay O
PUNCT O
175 O
to O
fix O
it O
we O
were O
like O
we O
will O
just O
by O
a O
portable O
mouse S-POS
which O
would O
be O
way O
cheaper O
but O
they O
refused O
to O
send O
the O
laptop O
back O
until O
we O
paid O
the O
PUNCT O
175 O
and O
it O
was O
fixed O
PUNCT O

-i O
give O
up O
on O
my O
data O
PUNCT O
i O
just O
want O
a O
computer O
reasonably O
fast O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
shooting O
sparks O
PUNCT O

tech B-POS
support E-POS
tells O
me O
the O
latter O
problem O
is O
a O
power B-NEG
supply E-NEG
problem O
and O
have O
offered O
to O
fix O
it O
if O
it O
happens O
again O
PUNCT O

upon O
giving O
them O
the O
serial O
number O
the O
first O
thing O
i O
was O
told O
PUNCT O
was O
that O
it O
was O
out O
of O
warranty S-NEU
and O
i O
could O
pay O
to O
have O
it O
repaired O
PUNCT O

laptop O
was O
in O
new O
condition O
and O
operational O
PUNCT O
but O
for O
the O
audio S-NEG
problem O
when O
1st O
sent O
for O
repair O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
disappointed O
when O
i O
realized O
that O
the O
keyboard S-NEG
does O
n't O
light O
up O
on O
this O
model O
PUNCT O

the O
laptop O
was O
very O
easy O
to O
set B-POS
up E-POS
PUNCT O

well O
PUNCT O
maybe O
i O
was O
just O
very O
unlucky O
PUNCT O

i O
loaded O
windows B-POS
7 E-POS
via O
bootcamp S-POS
and O
it O
works O
flawlessly O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
never O
had O
to O
shut O
down O
the O
computer O
unexpectedly O
and O
the O
computer O
has O
never O
froze O
on O
me O
PUNCT O

i O
hate O
the O
display B-NEG
screen E-NEG
and O
i O
have O
done O
everything O
i O
could O
do O
the O
change O
it O
PUNCT O

this O
computer O
will O
last O
you O
at O
least O
7 O
years O
PUNCT O
thats O
an O
amazing O
life S-POS
spanned O
an O
electronic O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
very O
pleased O
with O
my O
purchase O
PUNCT O

i O
ca O
n't O
say O
enough O
of O
how O
satisfied O
i O
am O
with O
their O
product B-POS
and I-POS
help I-POS
aftermarket E-POS
PUNCT O

-called O
machouse O
amsterdam O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
temporary O
replacement O
PUNCT O
no O
answer O
PUNCT O

i O
bought O
it O
during O
the O
recent O
comex O
it O
show O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
had O
nothing O
but O
problems O
since O
the O
day O
i O
took O
it O
out O
of O
the O
box O
PUNCT O

the O
image S-POS
is O
great O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
soud S-POS
is O
excelent O
PUNCT O

where O
you O
click O
and O
hold O
and O
drag O
it O
picture O
PUNCT O
link O
PUNCT O
etc O
to O
where O
you O
want O
it O
PUNCT O

the O
macbook O
rarely O
requires O
a O
hard O
reboot O
PUNCT O

i O
love O
it O
PUNCT O

now O
for O
the O
hardware S-NEG
problems O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
an O
all O
around O
waste O
of O
money O
for O
me O
PUNCT O

also O
it O
is O
light O
weight O
compared O
to O
others O
PUNCT O

waiting O
for O
the O
i7 S-POS
was O
well O
worth O
it O
PUNCT O
great O
value O
for O
the O
price S-POS
PUNCT O

i O
asked O
how O
they O
would O
determine O
that O
since O
there O
are O
no O
scratches O
PUNCT O
dents O
or O
other O
signs O
of O
damage O
and O
was O
told O
that O
was O
the O
only O
way O
this O
type O
of O
damage O
could O
happen O
PUNCT O

the O
macbook O
arrived O
in O
a O
nice O
twin B-POS
packing E-POS
and O
sealed O
in O
the O
box O
PUNCT O
all O
the O
functions S-POS
works O
great O
PUNCT O

reason O
why O
PUNCT O
it O
's O
because O
when O
you O
buy O
it O
PUNCT O
you O
know O
first O
thing O
that O
you O
will O
not O
lose O
any O
value S-POS
for O
that O
laptop O
PUNCT O
the O
price S-POS
will O
stay O
the O
same O
for O
the O
next O
year O
PUNCT O
and O
even O
if O
apple O
does O
decides O
to O
change O
mode O
PUNCT O
your O
laptop O
value S-POS
will O
only O
drop O
10-20 O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
unlike O
pc O
laptops O
which O
drop O
more O
than O
80 O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

so O
PUNCT O
buyers O
beware O
PUNCT O

do O
i O
like O
the O
computer O
PUNCT O
well O
PUNCT O
other O
than O
not O
getting O
viruses O
PUNCT O
i O
guess O
it O
is O
ok O
PUNCT O

its O
a O
dog O
plain O
and O
simple O
PUNCT O

my O
hp O
is O
very O
heavy O
PUNCT O

best O
buy O
was O
great O
as O
always O
and O
accepted O
the O
return O
and O
gave O
me O
another O
model O
1764 O
PUNCT O

i O
can O
actually O
get O
work O
done O
with O
this O
mac O
PUNCT O
and O
not O
fight O
with O
it O
like O
my O
tired O
old O
pc O
laptop O
PUNCT O

and O
i O
'm O
still O
paying O
the O
bloody O
financing O
PUNCT O
for O
a O
product O
which O
did O
n't O
last O
me O
at O
least O
three O
years O
PUNCT O

games S-NEG
being O
the O
main O
issue O
PUNCT O

while O
the O
computer O
seems O
to O
be O
set O
up O
in O
a O
common O
sense O
way O
rather O
than O
in O
geek-speak O
PUNCT O
there O
are O
certain O
quirks O
that O
can O
drive O
you O
crazy O
trying O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
pc O
world O
PUNCT O

thank O
god O
for O
ctrl O
zbottom O
line O
PUNCT O
i O
've O
been O
using O
laptops O
since O
the O
mid O
90s O
and O
probably O
the O
majority O
of O
brands O
out O
there O
PUNCT O

even O
with O
virus B-NEG
protection E-NEG
PUNCT O
it O
always O
turned O
off O
when O
updates S-NEG
were O
needed O
and O
installed O
PUNCT O

even O
so O
PUNCT O
i O
like O
playing O
online O
games S-NEU
PUNCT O
so O
it O
was O
wonderful O
that O
there O
is O
a O
feature S-POS
where O
i O
can O
dualboot O
windows S-POS
PUNCT O

that O
's O
the O
downside O
for O
me O
PUNCT O

it O
has O
good O
speed S-POS
and O
plenty O
of O
hard B-POS
drive I-POS
space E-POS
PUNCT O

it O
's O
so O
useable O
and O
responsive O
PUNCT O

it O
has O
come O
into O
good O
use S-POS
for O
my O
finances O
PUNCT O
scheduling O
PUNCT O
my O
parents O
business O
expenses O
PUNCT O
and O
it O
is O
definitely O
amazing O
for O
gaming S-POS
PUNCT O

it O
was O
weird O
PUNCT O

i O
visited O
the O
apple O
store O
and O
was O
impressed O
with O
the O
17-inch O
macbook O
pro O
PUNCT O

looking O
to O
take O
my O
video O
and O
photo O
editing O
to O
the O
next O
level O
PUNCT O
i O
decided O
to O
purchase O
the O
mbp O
15in O
intel O
core O
i5 O
after O
reading O
consumer O
reviews O
as O
well O
as O
professional O
reviews O
of O
this O
laptop O
PUNCT O

it O
doesnt O
work S-NEG
worth O
a O
damn O
PUNCT O

i O
will O
be O
returning O
it O
and O
switching O
brands O
when O
i O
get O
to O
best O
buy O
PUNCT O

product B-NEG
support E-NEG
very O
poor O
as O
each O

call O
costs O
me O
long O

frustrated O
i O
hung O
up O
and O
tried O
to O
call O
back O
3 O
days O
later O
to O
be O
told O
that O
it O
takes O
2-3 O
days O
for O

time O
PUNCT O

may O
be O
better O
for O
the O
occasional O
web O

PUNCT O

not O
super O
fancy O
PUNCT O
but O
not O
super O
expensive O
either O
PUNCT O

the O

stopped O
working O
on O

after O
10 O

PUNCT O

i O
'm O
going O
back O

PUNCT O

great O
PUNCT O
quick O
laptop O
for O
the O
money O
PUNCT O

with O
the O
switch S-NEG
being O
at O
the O

you O
need O
to O
memorize O
the O

rather O
than O
just O
flicking O

PUNCT O

until O

you O

PUNCT O
the O

however O
i O
would O
highly O
suggest O
purchasing O

the O

maybe O
this O

maybe O
not O

PUNCT O
the O

using O

like O
a O

PUNCT O

whenever O

PUNCT O
well O
built S-POS

PUNCT O

the O
cool O
thing O
about O
the O

book O
was O
that O
i O
went O
on O
my O
honeymoon O
and O
shot O
a O
bunch O
of O

with O
my O

PUNCT O
then O
i O
came O
back O

put O
them O
onto O
my O

and O
made O
a O
pretty O
good O
dvd O
movie O
with O
all O
the O

videos O
from O
my O
trip O
PUNCT O

after O
4 O

PUNCT O
i O
managed O

was O
able O
to O
send O

a O
scanned O

PUNCT O

it O
was O
secure O
and O
easy O

PUNCT O

the O

has O
a O
bluray B-NEU

the O

i O

i O
actually O

PUNCT O

after O
replacing O
the O
hard B-NEU

the O

stopped O
working O
3 O
months O
of O
use O
which O
was O
frustrating O
PUNCT O

i O
love O
the O
easy O
to O
see O
screen S-POS
PUNCT O
and O
it O
works S-POS
well O
for O
work O
PUNCT O
persoal O
or O
just O
play O
PUNCT O

one O
drawback O
i O
noticed O
was O
sound B-NEG
quality I-NEG
via I-NEG
usb E-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
am O
not O
going O
to O
sit O
here O
and O
complain O
about O
it O
not O
having O
a O
cd O
drive O
and O
what O
not O
because O
it O
is O
a O
netbook O
PUNCT O
it O
is O
made O
to O
be O
compact O
and O
if O
you O
want O
all O
the O
other O
stuff O
get O
a O
laptop O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
psyched O
PUNCT O

if O
i O
have O
a O
few O
hundred O
dollars O
to O
spare O
PUNCT O
i O
'd O
buy O
the O
pro O
line O
though O
PUNCT O
the O
253 O
and O
266 O
ghz O
model O
PUNCT O

needs O
power O
and O
mouse B-NEG
cable E-NEG
to O
plug O
in O
back O
instead O
of O
side O
PUNCT O
in O
the O
way O
of O
operating O
a O
mouse S-NEG
in O
small O
area O
PUNCT O

it O
seems O
to O
be O
incompatible O
with O
everything O
else O
PUNCT O

we O
use O
the O
built B-NEU
in I-NEU
tools E-NEU
often O
PUNCT O
itunes S-POS
is O
open O
nearly O
every O
day O
and O
works O
great O
with O
my O
iphone O
PUNCT O

the O
size S-POS
of O
has O
actually O
help O
me O
out O
quite O
a O
bit O
by O
me O
being O
able O
to O
fit O
it O
in O
an O
already O
full O
backpack O
and O
to O
use O
it O
at O
a O
resturant O
where O
the O
food O
on O
the O

is O
always O
so O
space O
consuming O
PUNCT O

we O
are O
addicted O
to O
the O
mac O
PUNCT O

maybe O
three O
or O
four O
months O
ago O
it O
started O
blinking O
all O
of O
the O
sudden O
PUNCT O

everything O
about O
a O
mac O
is O
wonderful O
PUNCT O
it O
takes O
a O
little O
used O
to O
learning O
and O
getting O
used O
to O
the O
new O
system S-NEU
PUNCT O
but O
you O
will O
learn O
fast O
and O
its O
all O
worth O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
also O
bought O
one O
for O
my O
wife O
PUNCT O
and O
3 O
for O
my O
office O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
can O
imagine O
is O
that O
sony O
jumped O
on O
early O
specifications O
for O
vista S-NEG
requirements O
from O
microsoft O
and O
designed O
it O
to O
those O
inadequate O
requirements O
PUNCT O

the O
mouse O
is O
a O
little O
bit O
different O
than O
what O
you O
're O
used O
to O
though O
it O
has O
one O
big O
flat O
panel O
and O
one O
full O
bar O
instead O
of O
two O
separate O
ones O
to O
click O
with O
but O
you O
get O
used O
to O
it O
quite O
quickly O
PUNCT O

it O
took O
several O
weeks O
just O
to O
get O
them O
to O
acknowledge O
that O
i O
owned O
the O
warranty S-NEG
PUNCT O

it O
was O
a O
huge O
monstrosity O
of O
a O

PUNCT O

-i O
propose O
that O
they O
can O
just O
swap O
the O
hard B-NEU
drives E-NEU
PUNCT O

so O
having O
the O
ac B-NEG
plug E-NEG
go O
out O
on O
me O
and O
get O
lose O
or O
i O
could O
actually O
here O
it O
inside O

great O
for O
adding O

only O

so O
it O
was O
sent O
back O

the O
6th O

i O
was O
only O

it O
was O

time O
they O
come O
over O
PUNCT O

i O
work O
in O
film O
editing O
and O
post O
production O
PUNCT O
so O
i O
need O
a O
laptop O
that O
not O
only O
has O
power S-NEU
PUNCT O
but O
memory S-NEU
and O
speed S-NEU
as O
well O
PUNCT O

at O
first O
when O
i O
got O
this O
product O
PUNCT O
i O
loved O
it O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
what O
a O
laptop O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
PUNCT O

then O
i O
've O
fixed O
the O
dc B-NEU
jack E-NEU
inside O
the O
unit O
PUNCT O
rewired O
the O
dc B-NEU
jack E-NEU
to O
the O
outside O
of O
the O
laptop O
PUNCT O
replaced O
the O
power B-NEU
brick E-NEU
PUNCT O

it O
is O
easy O
to O
use S-POS
PUNCT O
has O
great O
screen B-POS
quality E-POS
PUNCT O
and O
every O
so O
light O
weight O
PUNCT O

i O
've O
been O
having O
endless O
problems O
since O
i O
bought O
the O
computer O
PUNCT O
only O
1 O
month O
ago O

i O
wanted O
to O
spend O
around O
PUNCT O
700 O
to O
PUNCT O
800 O
so O
i O
was O
directed O
to O
a O
nice O
looking O
hp O
laptop O
PUNCT O

i O
've O
had O
my O
macbook O
pro O
since O
august O
2009 O
PUNCT O

unfortunately O
PUNCT O
the O
laptop O
i O
purchased O
was O
also O
a O
dell O
and O
again O
PUNCT O
i O
have O
to O
say O
i O
hated O
it O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
the O
first O
time O
that O
i O
tried O
and O
owning O
a O
netbook O
although O
i O
have O
used O
3 O
different O
laptops O
in O
the O
past O
10 O
years O
PUNCT O
i O
find O
not O
much O
difference O
except O
of O
course O
for O
the O
screen B-NEU
size E-NEU
PUNCT O

everything O
about O
the O
mac O
is O
not O
only O
visually O
appealing O
PUNCT O
but O
very O
easy O
to O
use S-POS
PUNCT O

but O
if O
you O
ca O
n't O
make O
your O
product O
last O
more O
than O
a O
year O
PUNCT O
you O
will O
not O
get O
my O
business O
again O
PUNCT O

seems O
like O
maybe O
a O
bad O
shipment S-NEG
from O
toshiba O
PUNCT O

currently O
if O
i O
use O
the O
laptop O
i O
ca O
n't O
sit O
it O
on O
my O
lap O
because O
it O
will O
burn O
my O
legs O
PUNCT O

i O
can O
leave O
my O
macbook O
uncharged O
for O
upwards O
of O
eight O
hours O
and O
it O
wo O
n't O
even O
be O
dead O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
find O
that O
my O
macbook O
has O
a O
lot O
more O
bells O
and O
whistles O
than O
a O
normal O
pc O
especially O
if O
you O
enjoy O
technology O
PUNCT O
downloading O
pictures O
and O
graphic O
design O
PUNCT O

first O
the O
screen S-NEG
goes O
completely O
out O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
learning O
the O
finger O
options O
for O
the O
mousepad S-POS
that O
allow O
for O
quicker O
browsing S-POS
of O
web O
pages O
PUNCT O

we O
researched O
and O
found O
the O
best O
price S-POS
at O
macconnection O
PUNCT O

i O
droped O
this O
once O
from O
thetable O
when O
my O
baby O
girl O
grabed O
me O
one O
day O
and O
it O
is O
still O
working O
with O
no O
issues O
PUNCT O

returned O
it O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
a O
cheap O
throw O
together O
PUNCT O

it O
easily O
fits O
into O
most O
computer O
bags O
but O
does O
n't O
weigh O
down O
a O
backpack O
or O
satchel O
when O
being O
carried O
with O
spirals O
and/or O
textbooks O
PUNCT O

i O
actually O
had O
the O
hard B-NEG
drive E-NEG
replaced O
twice O
PUNCT O
the O
mother B-NEG
board E-NEG
once O
PUNCT O
the O
dvd B-NEG
drive E-NEG
twice O
PUNCT O
then O
they O
finally O
agreed O
to O
replace O
it O
PUNCT O
all O
of O
this O
in O
less O
than O
1 O
1/2 O
years O
PUNCT O

the O
guy O
then O
said O
that O
if O
i O
insist O
on O
having O
the O
hinge S-NEU
tightened O
PUNCT O
they O
can O
do O
it O
for O
me O
but O
i O
have O
to O
accept O
the O
condition O
after O
the O
repair O
PUNCT O

i O
've O
been O
a O
pc O
user O
and O
i O
just O
finally O
switched O
and O
i O
am O
never O
going O
back O
PUNCT O

will O
certainly O
use O
macconnection O
again O
PUNCT O

so O
you O
might O
ask O
PUNCT O
what O
did O
apple O
do O
for O
me O
PUNCT O

the O
ease O
of O
set B-POS
up E-POS
was O
terrific O
PUNCT O

this O
was O
around O
three O
years O
PUNCT O
maybe O
four O
years O
ago O
PUNCT O

please O
PUNCT O
anyone O
who O
is O
considering O
getting O
this O
computer O
PUNCT O
stop O
PUNCT O

i O
had O
my O
computer O
custom O
built O
from O
sonystylecom O
PUNCT O

this O
computer O
is O
really O
fast O
and O
i O
'm O
shocked O
as O
to O
how O
easy O
it O
is O
to O
get O
used O
to O
PUNCT O

from O
the O
get-go O
PUNCT O
the O
m6809 O
was O
unsteady O
in O
its O
operation S-NEG
PUNCT O

one O
of O
the O
wonderful O
things O
about O
macs O
is O
that O
they O
are O
virus O
free O
PUNCT O

after O
5 O
months O
of O
failed O
repairs O
PUNCT O
requested O
a O
full O
refund O
but O
was O
refused O
and O
it O
still O
is O
not O
repaired O
and O
acer O
is O
indifferent O
to O
the O
issue O
PUNCT O

you O
better O
believe O
my O
next O
computer O
will O
be O
a O
mac O
PUNCT O

with O
all O
the O
programs S-NEU
that O
came O
with O
it O
PUNCT O
such O
as O
ilife S-NEU
and O
iwork S-NEU
PUNCT O
i O
was O
set O
from O
the O
very O
beginning O
PUNCT O

best O
buy O
laughed O
when O
i O
told O
them O
they O
should O
replace O
it O
instead O
of O
expecting O
me O
to O
be O
without O
a O
computer O
again O
for O
another O
couple O
of O
weeks O
PUNCT O

there O
are O
no O
gold O
key O

too O
intall O
programs S-NEG
PUNCT O
you O
must O
use O
the O
serial O
numbers O
that O
it O
does O
not O
accept O
and O
then O
things O
are O
limited O
as O
far O
a O
working O
because O
they O
are O
only O
good O
for O
a O
short O
time O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
want O
a O
little O
more O
custom O
ability O
PUNCT O
drop O
a O
few O
bucks O
and O
upgrade O
to O
one O
of O
the O
more O
robust O
versions O
of O

the O

that O

at O

like O
you O

i O
especially O
like O
the O

PUNCT O

besides O
the O
great O
look S-POS
PUNCT O
it O
is O
a O
great O
machine O
PUNCT O

took O
it O
back O
as O
it O
was O
defective O
PUNCT O

this O
system O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
money O
or O
trouble O
trying O
to O
get O
it O
fix O
PUNCT O

i O
purchased O
it O
this O
year O
when O
my O
old O
hp O
laptop O
finally O
died O
and O
i O
was O
looking O
for O
something O
smaller O
and O
lighter O
than O
a O
laptop O
to O
carry O
around O
for O
classes O
and O
traveling O
PUNCT O

i O
bought O
this O
emachines O
notebook O
pc O
in O
january O
of O
this O
year O
and O
i O
am O
highly O
dissatisfied O
with O
it O
PUNCT O

even O
though O
the O
computer O
is O
larger O
they O
did O
not O
make O
the O
keyboard S-NEG
larger O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
type S-POS
on O
and O
feels O
great O
PUNCT O
besides O
the O
added O
feature S-POS
that O
the O
keyboard S-POS
is O
lighted O
PUNCT O

the O
feel S-POS
of O
this O
machine O
compared O
to O
the O
old O
macbook O
is O
far O
superior O
PUNCT O

thank O
you O
PUNCT O

i O
saved O
for O
this O
laptop O
for O
3 O
months O
and O
i O
can O
tell O
you O
personally O
it O
was O
worth O
the O
wait O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
had O
no O
problems O
with O
it O
unlike O
some O
hardware S-NEG
defects O
on O
past O
models O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
used O
different O
laptops O
in O
the O
past O
and O
i O
have O
to O
rate O
this O
one O
way O
above O
the O
rest O
PUNCT O

the O
quality S-POS
PUNCT O
engineering B-POS
design E-POS
and O
warranty S-POS
are O
superior O
-- O
covers O
damage O
from O
dropping O
the O

PUNCT O

it O
is O
so O
much O
fun O
to O
play O
with O
PUNCT O

if O
this O
is O
an O
improvement O
in O
customer B-NEG
service E-NEG
then O
i O
would O
hate O
too O
see O
what O
it O
was O
before O
PUNCT O

sure O
PUNCT O
the O
initial O
out O
of O
pocket O
expense S-NEG
is O
greater O
PUNCT O
but O
that O
should O
not O
dissuade O
anyone O
from O
the O
fact O
that O
these O
machines O
run S-POS
like O
none O
other O
on O
the O
planet O
PUNCT O
and O
when O
i O
factor O
in O
all O
the O
money O
in O
that O
i O
wasted O
on O
geek O
squad O
and O
the O
latest O
patches O
to O

my O

PUNCT O
it O
probably O
comes O
out O
about O
even O
anyhow O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
glad O
i O
did O
my O
research O
PUNCT O

the O
netbook O
is O
easier O
for O
me O
to O
take O
to O
bed O
and O
carry O
around O
with O
me O
PUNCT O

externally O
the O
keys S-NEG
on O

are O
falling O
off O

PUNCT O

the O

they O
don O

wrong O
with O
it O
PUNCT O

after O

PUNCT O
it O
was O

PUNCT O

very O
happy O

my O

recently O

PUNCT O

the O
price S-POS
is O
great O
for O
this O

PUNCT O
i O
only O
plan O
on O
using O

for O

in O

PUNCT O

it O
seemed O
to O
be O

a O
tip O
for O
people O
looking O
into O
this O

PUNCT O
do O
not O
buy O
it O
save O
up O
a O
bit O
more O
money O
and O
buy O
a O

that O
will O
last O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
waiting O
for O
this O

been O
holding O
off O
on O
buying O
a O
macbook O

until O
the O
new O
model O
came O
out O
PUNCT O

so O
i O
would O
not O
reccomend O
anyone O
buying O
this O
computer O

the O
best O
thing O
is O
even O
while O
doing O
almost O
ten O
or O
twenty O
things O
at O
once O
PUNCT O
it O
never O
slows O
down O
PUNCT O

i O
took O
it O
to O
the O
shop O
and O
they O
said O
it O
would O
cost O
too O
much O
to O
repair O
it O
PUNCT O

we O
also O
