charge O
it O

skip O
taking O

of O
the O
good O
battery B-POS
life E-POS
PUNCT O

i O
bought O
a O
hp O
pavilion O
dv4-1222nr O
laptop O
and O
have O
had O
so O
many O
problems O
with O
the O
computer O
PUNCT O

the O
tech B-NEU
guy E-NEU
then O
said O
the O
service B-NEG
center E-NEG
does O
not O
do O
1-to-1 O
exchange O
and O
i O
have O
to O
direct O
my O
concern O
to O
the O
"sales" B-NEG
team E-NEG
PUNCT O
which O
is O
the O
retail O
shop O
which O
i O
bought O
my O
netbook O
from O
PUNCT O

i O
investigated O
netbooks O
and O
saw O
the O
toshiba O
nb305-n410bl O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
of O
high O
quality S-POS
PUNCT O
has O
a O
killer O
gui S-POS
PUNCT O
is O
extremely O
stable O
PUNCT O
is O
highly O
expandable O
PUNCT O
is O
bundled O
with O
lots O
of O
very O
good O
applications S-POS
PUNCT O
is O
easy O
to O
use S-POS
PUNCT O
and O
is O
absolutely O
gorgeous O
PUNCT O

easy O
to O
start B-POS
up E-POS
and O
does O
not O
overheat O
as O
much O
as O
other O
laptops O
PUNCT O

sad O
very O
sad O
PUNCT O

i O
even O
got O
my O
teenage O
son O
one O
PUNCT O
because O
of O
the O
features S-POS
that O
it O
offers O
PUNCT O
like O
PUNCT O
ichat S-POS
PUNCT O
photobooth S-POS
PUNCT O
garage B-POS
band E-POS
and O
more O
PUNCT O

needless O
to O
say O
a O
pc O
that O
ca O
n't O
support O
a O
cell O
phone O
is O
less O
than O
useless O
PUNCT O

great O
laptop O
that O
offers O
many O
great O
features S-POS
PUNCT O

they O
have O
done O
absolutely O
nothing O
to O
fix O
the O
computer O
problem O
PUNCT O

one O
night O
i O
turned O
the O
freaking O
thing O
off O
after O
using O
it O
PUNCT O
the O
next O
day O
i O
turn O
it O
on O
PUNCT O
no O
gui S-NEG
PUNCT O
screen S-NEG
all O
dark O
PUNCT O
power B-NEU
light E-NEU
steady O
PUNCT O
hard B-NEG
drive I-NEG
light E-NEG
steady O
and O
not O
flashing O
as O
it O
usually O
does O
PUNCT O

still O
pretty O
pricey O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
've O
been O
putting O
off O
money O
for O
a O
while O
as O
a O
little O
macbook O
fund O
PUNCT O
and O
finally O
got O
to O
use O
it O
PUNCT O

in O
the O
shop O
PUNCT O
these O
macbooks O
are O
encased O
in O
a O
soft O
rubber B-POS
enclosure E-POS
PUNCT O
so O
you O
will O
never O
know O
about O
the O
razor O
edge S-NEG
until O
you O
buy O
it O
PUNCT O
get O
it O
home O
PUNCT O
break O
the O
seal O
and O
use O
it O
very O
clever O
con O
PUNCT O

however O
PUNCT O
the O
multi-touch B-POS
gestures E-POS
and O
large O
tracking B-POS
area E-POS
make O
having O
an O
external B-NEU
mouse E-NEU
unnecessary O
unless O
you O
're O
gaming S-NEU
PUNCT O

plus O
it O
is O
small O
and O
reasonably O
light O
so O
i O
can O
take O
it O
with O
me O
to O
and O
from O
work O
PUNCT O

i O
hate O
this O
one O
PUNCT O

they O
were O
totally O
unconcerned O
that O
the O
computer O
was O
not O
correctly O
repaired O
in O
the O
first O
place O
PUNCT O

the O
speed S-POS
is O
incredible O
and O
i O
am O
more O
than O
satisfied O
PUNCT O

on O
the O
bright O
side O
at O
least O
i O
was O
n't O
without O
my O
laptop O
for O
long O
this O
time O
PUNCT O

this O
laptop O
meets O
every O
expectation O
and O
windows B-POS
7 E-POS
is O
great O
PUNCT O

that O
's O
how O
frustrating O
it O
was O
PUNCT O

i O
can O
barely O
use O
any O
usb B-NEG
devices E-NEG
because O
they O
will O
not O
stay O
connected O
properly O
PUNCT O

the O
one O
down O
side O
to O
it O
is O
that O
when O
i O
play O
a O
certin O
game O
on O
here O
PUNCT O
it O
tends O
to O
freeze O
up O
sometimes O
PUNCT O
but O
thats O
the O
only O
bad O
thing O
about O
this O
computer O
PUNCT O

-no O
backlit O
keyboard O
PUNCT O
but O
not O
an O
issue O
for O
me O
PUNCT O

when O
i O
finally O
had O
everything O
running O
with O
all O
my O
software S-NEU
installed O
i O
plugged O
in O
my O
droid O
to O
recharge O
and O
the O
system S-NEG
crashed O
PUNCT O

i O
ca O
n't O
even O
turn O
it O
off O
PUNCT O

one O
suggestion O
i O
do O
have O
PUNCT O
is O
to O
not O
bother O
getting O
microsoft B-NEG
office I-NEG
for I-NEG
the I-NEG
mac E-NEG
expecting O
it O
will O
work O
just O
like O
you O
knew O
it O
to O
on O
a O
pc O
PUNCT O

i O
also O
got O
the O
added O
bonus O
of O
a O
30" B-POS
hd I-POS
monitor E-POS
PUNCT O
which O
really O
helps O
to O
extend O
my O
screen S-NEU
and O
keep O
my O
eyes O
fresh O
PUNCT O

would O
do O
business O
again O
PUNCT O

the O
machine O
is O
slow O
to O
boot B-NEG
up E-NEG
and O
occasionally O
crashes O
completely O
PUNCT O

after O
paying O
several O
hundred O
dollars O
for O
this O
service S-NEG
PUNCT O
it O
is O
frustrating O
that O
you O
can O
not O
get O
help O
after O
hours O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
had O
the O
luxury O
sarcasm O
of O
owning O
2 O
of O
these O
laptops O
PUNCT O

what O
a O
waste O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
a O
total O
dhell O
experience O
that O
i O
will O
never O
repeat O
PUNCT O

there O
are O
a O
few O
flaws O
as O
well O
that O
i O
noticed O
PUNCT O

completely O
worth O
every O
single O
penny O
dime O
and O
nickel O
PUNCT O

i O
tried O
to O
upgrade O
it O
to O
a O
newer O
version O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
ago O
and O
i O
still O
have O
the O
same O
problem O
PUNCT O

i O
did O
have O
to O
replace O
the O
battery O
once O
PUNCT O
but O
that O
was O
only O
a O
couple O
months O
ago O
and O
it O
's O
been O
working O
perfect O
ever O
since O
PUNCT O

PUNCT O
in O
the O
past O
four O
years O
i O
've O
had O
it O
i O
have O
never O
once O
gotten O
a O
virus O
PUNCT O

i O
love O
the O
operating B-POS
system E-POS
and O
the O
preloaded B-POS
software E-POS
PUNCT O

they O
were O
great O
in O
handling O
this O
problem O
PUNCT O
and O
i O
'm O
looking O
forward O
in O
purchasing O
additonal O
products O
from O
them O
in O
the O
future O
PUNCT O

i O
've O
tried O
going O
back O
to O
xl O
but O
there O
still O
problems O
PUNCT O

the O
best O
thing O
about O
this O
laptop O
is O
the O
price S-POS
along O
with O
some O
of O
the O
newer O
features S-POS
PUNCT O

after O
numerous O
attempts O
of O
trying O
including O
setting O
the O
clock B-NEG
in I-NEG
bios I-NEG
setup E-NEG
directly O
PUNCT O
i O
gave O
upi O
am O
a O
techie O
PUNCT O

you O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
talk O
to O
an O
american O
warranty B-NEG
service E-NEG
is O
out O
of O
country O
PUNCT O

but O
it O
may O
be O
potentially O
hundreds O
or O
thousands O
in O
the O
near O
future O
PUNCT O

but O
now O
i O
have O
realized O
its O
a O
problem O
with O
this O
brand S-NEG
PUNCT O

it O
can O
not O
save O
the O
correct O
date O
and O
time O
i O
set O
PUNCT O

and O
this O
is O
n't O
just O
my O
one O
experine O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
mac O
which O
is O
portable O
and O
has O
all O
the O
features S-POS
that O
i O
was O
looking O
for O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
one O
to O
my O
friends O

i O
honestly O
love O
my O
mac O
PUNCT O
thats O
why O
i O
am O
a O
self O
proclaimed O
mac O
addict O
PUNCT O

and O
these O
are O
some O
reasons O
you O
should O
get O
a O
macbook O
pro O
PUNCT O

also O
kinda O
loud O
when O
the O
fan S-NEG
was O
running O
PUNCT O

i O
purchased O
this O
laptop O
while O
on O
a O
business O
trip O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
my O
email O
PUNCT O

there O
also O
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
hard B-NEG
disc E-NEG
as O
certain O
times O
windows S-NEG
loads O
but O
claims O
to O
not O
be O
able O
to O
find O
any O
drivers S-NEU
or O
files O
PUNCT O

drivers S-POS
updated O
ok O
but O
the O
bios B-NEG
update E-NEG
froze O
the O
system S-NEG
up O
and O
the O
computer O
shut O
down O
PUNCT O

-they O
lost O
my O

totally O
spoiled O
and O
i O
ca O
n't O

PUNCT O

the O
keyboard S-NEG
is O
too O
slick O
PUNCT O

nightly O
my O

defrags O

and O
runs O
a O
virus B-NEU

PUNCT O

it O
's O
like O

punds E-NEG
PUNCT O
but O
if O

PUNCT O

i O

PUNCT O

the O

so O
when O

not O
working O
at O
all O
PUNCT O

then O
after O
4 O
or O
so O
months O
the O

stopped O
working O
so O
i O
was O
forced O
to O
go O
out O
and O
buy O
new O
hardware S-NEG
just O
to O
keep O
this O
computer O
running O
PUNCT O

i O
took O
it O
back O
to O

buy O
where O
they O
were O
so O
helpful O
and O
immediately O
gave O
me O
a O
new O
one O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
had O
pc O
for O
four O
years O
i O
can O
almost O
gaurentee O
that O
something O
would O
of O
gone O
wrong O
by O
now O
PUNCT O
maybe O
even O
forcing O
you O
to O
replace O
your O
entire O
computer O
PUNCT O

*2 O
weeks O
after O
giving O
the O
computer O
for O

headquarters O
PUNCT O
they O
report O
that O
they O
have O
not O
looked O
at O
it O
yet O
but O
it O
is O
on O
the O
top O
of O
the O
stack O
PUNCT O

this O
machine O
delivers O
PUNCT O

then O
2 O
of O
my O
nephews O
were O
going O
into O
music O
and O
both O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
the O
macbook O
pro O
PUNCT O

i O
complain O
again O
PUNCT O

this O
laptop O
is O
insane O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

if O
a O
website O
ever O
freezes O
which O
is O
rare O
PUNCT O
its O
really O
easy O
to O
force B-POS
quit E-POS
PUNCT O

it O
rarely O
works S-NEG
and O
when O
it O
does O
it O
's O
incredibly O
slow O
PUNCT O

i O
also O
enjoy O
the O
fact O
that O
my O
macbook O
pro O
laptop O
allows O
me O
to O
run O
windows B-POS
7 E-POS
on O
it O
by O
using O
the O
vmware B-NEU
program E-NEU
PUNCT O

it O
's O
so O
much O
easier O
to O
navigate S-POS
through O
the O
operating B-POS
system E-POS
PUNCT O
to O
find B-POS
files E-POS
PUNCT O
and O
it O
runs S-POS
a O
lot O
faster O
PUNCT O

purchased O
a O
toshiba O
lap O
top O
it O
worked O
good O
until O
just O
after O
the O
warrenty S-NEG
went O
out O
PUNCT O

i O
always O
swore O
by O
pcs O
and O
would O
never O
consider O
a O
mac O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
now O
my O
3rd O
macbook O
pro O
and O
i O
really O
honestly O
love O
it O
PUNCT O

for O
2 O
months O
PUNCT O

i O
wanted O
to O
purchase O
the O
extended B-NEU
warranty E-NEU
and O
they O
refused O
PUNCT O
because O
they O
knew O
it O
was O
trouble O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
not O
like O
i O
have O
used O
for O
half O
a O
year O
and O
then O
complained O
about O
it O
PUNCT O

still O
trying O
to O
learn O
how O
to O
use O
it O
PUNCT O

the O
reality O
was O
PUNCT O
it O
heated O
up O
very O
quickly O
PUNCT O
and O
took O
way O
too O
long O
to O
do O
simple O
things O
PUNCT O
like O
opening B-NEG
my I-NEG
documents I-NEG
folder E-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
bought O
the O
netbook O
because O
it O
was O
smaller O
and O
lighter O
for O
me O
to O
carry O
around O
PUNCT O

we O
'll O
save O
our O
money O
to O
replace O
it O
with O
a O
mac O
again O
PUNCT O

thank O
you O
for O
your O
great O
product O
PUNCT O

this O
company O
truely O
does O
make O
horrible O
products O
and O
doesnt O
seem O
to O
because O
they O
are O
certain O
things O
like O
this O
never O
happen O
PUNCT O

i O
had O
always O
used O
pcs O
and O
been O
constantly O
frustrated O
by O
the O
crashing O
and O
the O
poorly O
designed O
operating B-NEG
systems E-NEG
that O
were O
never O
very O
intuitive O
PUNCT O

sorry O
toshiba O
PUNCT O
but O
1st O
impressions O
do O
count O
for O
something O
PUNCT O

then O
PUNCT O
within O
5 O
months O
PUNCT O
the O
charger S-NEG
crapped O
out O
on O
me O
PUNCT O

and O
if O
you O
have O
a O
iphone O
or O
ipod O
touch O
you O
can O
connect O
and O
download O
songs O
to O
it O
at O
high O
speed S-POS
PUNCT O

overall O
this O
laptop O
is O
great O
PUNCT O

i O
love O
the O
glass B-POS
touchpad E-POS
PUNCT O

i O
continued O
to O
take O
the O
computer O
in O
again O
and O
they O
replaced O
the O
hard B-NEG
drive E-NEG
and O
mother B-NEG
board E-NEG
yet O
again O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
using O
the O
external B-POS
speaker I-POS
sound E-POS
is O
good O
PUNCT O

ok O
PUNCT O
this O
is O
probably O
the O
best O
laptop O
series O
ever O
devised O
by O
apple O
PUNCT O

as O
of O
a O
couple O
weeks O
ago O
the O
middle O
portion O
of O
the O

from O

PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
about O
4 O
inches O

is O
hardly O
visible O
PUNCT O

still O
testing O
the O

life E-NEG
as O
i O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
better O
PUNCT O
but O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
upgrade O
PUNCT O

then O
hp O
sends O
it O
back O
to O
me O
with O
the O
hardware S-NEG
screwed O
up O
PUNCT O
not O
able O
to O
connect O
PUNCT O

i O
just O
hope O
the O
reputation O
that O
toshiba O
has O
is O
true O
and O
i O
wo O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
a O
crash O
PUNCT O

oh O
yeah O
PUNCT O
do O
n't O
forget O
the O
expensive O
shipping S-NEG
to O
and O
from O
hp O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
recommend O
anyone O
to O
buy O
from O
pcconnection O
express O
PUNCT O

good O
luck O
PUNCT O

everything O
is O
so O
easy O
to O
use S-POS
PUNCT O
mac B-POS
software E-POS
is O
just O
so O
much O
simpler O
than O
microsoft B-NEG
software E-NEG
PUNCT O

my O
favorite O
by O
far O
PUNCT O
although O
the O
most O
expensive O
PUNCT O
was O
my O
sony O
PUNCT O

and O
if O
you O
do O
a O
lot O
of O

after O

a O
week O
i O
finally O

told O
that O
the O

had O
failed O
and O
so O
they O
installed O
a O
new O
motherboard S-NEG
PUNCT O

it O
was O
slow O
PUNCT O
locked O
up O
PUNCT O
and O
also O

after O
only O
2 O
months O
PUNCT O

they O
had O
to O
replace O
the O
motherboard S-NEG
in O

yes O
PUNCT O
the O
computer O
was O
light O

PUNCT O
less O

was O
pretty O

PUNCT O
if O

at I-NEG
microsoft E-NEG
PUNCT O
there O
is O
a O
charge O
PUNCT O
which O
i O
believe O
is O
robbery O
PUNCT O
since O
you O
are O
charged O
enormous O
amounts O
for O
a O
very O
badly O
designed O
system S-NEG
PUNCT O
which O
most O
people O
would O
have O
went O
with O

if O
they O
could O
PUNCT O

there O
is O
a O
little O
indent O
to O
help O
open O
it O
PUNCT O
but O
good O
luck O
with O
that O
PUNCT O

i O
love O

is O
a O
vast O

this O
is O
what O
they O
told O
me O
PUNCT O
it O

that O

the O
reason O
we O
no O

call O

PUNCT O
and O
simply O
categorize O
them O
as O

PUNCT O

after O

PUNCT O
i O
chose O
the O

if O
you O
really O
want O
a O
bang-up O

PUNCT O
then O
it O

my O
favorite O
part O

that O
it O

i O
can O

another O
thing O

one O
drawback O
PUNCT O
i O
wish O
the O

when O
the O

what O
a O
great O

and O
garmin O
could O
not O
determine O
the O
problemafter O
spending O
about O
2 O
hours O
with O
me O
PUNCT O
so O
i O
returned O
it O
and O
purchased O
a O
toshiba O

that O
seems O
even O
nicer O
and O
i O
was O
able O
to O
load O
all O

my O

with O
no O

PUNCT O

i O
play O
a O

that O
completely O
wiped O

PUNCT O

would O
pay O

could O

keep O
a O

everything O
i O

PUNCT O

somehow O
a O
bit O
more O

PUNCT O

the O
bluetooth S-NEG

not O
there O
at O
all O
PUNCT O
and O
the O

would O

there O
PUNCT O
but O
the O

would O
hang O
after O

was O
1/2 O
way O
done O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
not O
recommend O

a O
nasty O

PUNCT O

the O
brand O
of O

has O
just O
become O
ingrained O
in O
our O

now O
PUNCT O

keep O
in O
mind O
that O
apple O
started O
it O
all O
PUNCT O

by O
the O
way O

PUNCT O
they O
offer O
a O

PUNCT O

the O

incredibly O
bright O
PUNCT O
much O
brighter O

my O

very O
crisp O
PUNCT O

we O
were O
pc O
users O
PUNCT O

the O

seems O
to O
always O
perform O

much O
better O

PUNCT O

after O
that O
the O
said O
it O
was O
under O
warranty S-NEU
PUNCT O

the O
start B-NEG
menu E-NEG
is O
not O
the O
easiest O
thing O
to O
navigate S-NEG
due O
to O
the O
stacking O
PUNCT O

only O
thing O
i O
would O
want O
to O
add O
to O
this O
is O
an O
internal O
bluray B-NEG
read/write I-NEG

PUNCT O

this O
computer O
was O
awful O
PUNCT O
i O
would O
never O
recomend O
it O
to O
another O
person O
PUNCT O

the O
service B-NEG
tech E-NEG
said O
he O
had O
tried O
to O
duplicate O
the O
damage O
and O
was O
n't O
able O
to O
recreate O
it O
therefore O
it O
had O
to O
be O
their O
defect O
PUNCT O

the O

store E-NEG
i O
purchased O
this O
from O
sent O
it O
back O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
eventually O
i O
got O
a O
new O
or O
repaired O
machine O
approximately O
3 O
weeks O
later O
PUNCT O

i O
loved O
it O
then O
PUNCT O
but O
unfortunately O
it O
was O
before O
the O
days O
of O
wireless O
internet O
PUNCT O

really O
like O
the O
textured O
surface S-POS
which O
shows O
no O
fingerprints O
PUNCT O

i O
will O
never O
again O
buy O
another O
acer O
PUNCT O
not O
will O
i O
buy O
gateway O
PUNCT O
or O
emachine O
as O
they O
are O
all O
from O
the O
same O
company O
PUNCT O

the O
screen S-POS
is O
bright O
and O
the O
keyboard S-POS
is O
nice O
PUNCT O

i O
look O
forward O
to O
years O
of O
use O
PUNCT O
it O
has O
held O
up O
well O
over O
the O
years O
and O
it O
fits O
my O
needs O
very O
well O
PUNCT O

im O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
computer O
PUNCT O

but O
the O
machine O
is O
awesome O
and O
ilife S-POS
is O
great O
and O
i O
love O
snow B-POS
leopard I-POS
x E-POS
PUNCT O

i O
thought O
learning O
the O
mac B-POS
os E-POS
would O
be O
hard O
PUNCT O
but O
it O
is O
easily O
picked O
up O
if O
you O
are O
familiar O
with O
a O
pc O
PUNCT O

my O
kids O
have O
to O
take O
their O
pcs O
in O
once O
a O
year O
to O
have O
them O
de-bugged O
PUNCT O

i O
had O
static O
in O
the O
output O
PUNCT O
and O
i O
had O
to O
reduce O
the O
sound B-NEG
output I-NEG
quality E-NEG
to O
fm O
as O
opposed O
to O
the O
default O
cd O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
a O
laugh O
too O
PUNCT O

since O
i O
purchased O
my O
toshiba O
netbook O
PUNCT O
i O
have O
been O
very O
pleased O
with O
it O
PUNCT O
i O
have O
a O
laptob O
and O
a O
desktop O
PUNCT O

i O
bought O
my O
macbook O
a O
few O
months O
ago O
and O
it O
has O
been O
my O
baby O
ever O
since O
PUNCT O

that O
is O
how O
it O
is O
able O
to O
function O
better O
than O
any O
other O
pc O
PUNCT O

i O
custom O
ordered O
the O
machine O
from O
hp O
and O
could O
not O
understand O
the O
techie S-NEG
due O
to O
his O
accent O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
easy O
to O
use S-POS
and O
lightweight O
PUNCT O

i O
went O
to O
toshiba B-POS
online I-POS
help E-POS
and O
found O
some O
suggestions O
to O
fix O
it O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
a O
bit O
heavy O
PUNCT O

after O
trying O
to O
get O
some O
help O
he O
disconnected O
on O
me O
PUNCT O

they O
also O
have O
a O
longer O
service B-POS
life E-POS
than O
other O
computers O
i O
have O
several O
friends O
who O
still O
use O
the O
older O
apple O
powerbooks O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
check O
you O
will O
find O
the O
same O
notebook O
with O
the O
above O
missing O
ports S-NEU
and O
a O
dual O
core O
amd O
or O
intel O
processor S-NEU
PUNCT O

this O
laptop O
is O
a O
great O
price S-POS
and O
has O
a O
sleek O
look S-POS
PUNCT O

i O
especially O
like O
the O
keyboard S-POS
which O
has O
chiclet O
type O
keys S-POS
PUNCT O

small O
screen O
somewhat O
limiting O
but O
great O
for O
travel O
PUNCT O

one O
of O
the O
primary O
reasons O
why O
i O
purchased O
an O
ipad O
was O
to O
store O
photographs O
so O
that O
i O
could O
show O
to O
my O
customers O
PUNCT O

runs O
hot O
i O
thought O
we O
were O
paying O
for O
quality S-NEG
in O
our O
decision O
to O
buy O
an O
apple O
product O
PUNCT O

for O
the O
not O
so O
good O
PUNCT O
i O
got O
the O
stock B-NEG
screen E-NEG
PUNCT O
which O
is O
very O
glossy O
PUNCT O

the O
gray B-POS
color E-POS
was O
a O
good O
choice O
PUNCT O

this O
was O
the O
second O
computer O
and O
brand O
bought O
that O
day O
PUNCT O

very O
disappointing O
PUNCT O

i O
love O
this O
product O
because O
it O
is O
toshiba O
and O
its O
156 O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
like O
to O
have O
volume B-NEG
buttons E-NEG
rather O
than O
the O
adjustment O
that O
is O
on O
the O
front O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
my O
first O
computer O
purchase O

people O
know O
what O
they O
are O
talking O
about O
and O
they O
have O
pride O
in O
the O
product O
that O
they O
are O
selling O
PUNCT O

would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
netbook O
though O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
had O
several O
machines O
over O
the O
years O
PUNCT O
both O
for O
personal O
and O
business O
use O
PUNCT O

i O
bought O
a O
protector S-NEU
for O
my O
key B-POS
pad E-POS
and O
it O
works O
great O
PUNCT O

the O
magnetic B-POS
plug-in I-POS
power I-POS
charging I-POS
power I-POS
cord E-POS
is O
great O
i O
even O
put O
it O
to O
the O
test O
by O
accident O
excellent O
innovation O
PUNCT O

well O
i O
got O
this O
computer O
from O
best O
buy O
and O
i O
have O
had O
nothing O
but O
problems O
i O
bought O
the O
computer O
with O
a O
virus O
PUNCT O

it O
seems O
they O
could O
have O
updated O
xp S-POS
and O
done O
without O
creating O
vista S-NEG
PUNCT O

it O
is O
easy O
to O
use S-POS
PUNCT O
fast O
and O
has O
great O
graphics S-POS
for O
the O
money O
PUNCT O

i O
decided O
i O
wanted O
a O
laptop O
so O
i O
went O
into O
the O
bby O
store O
PUNCT O

i O
like O
how O
the O
mac B-POS
os E-POS
is O
so O
simple O
and O
easy O
to O
use S-POS
PUNCT O

while O
apple O
's O
saving O
grace O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
at O
least O
stand O
behind O
their O
products O
PUNCT O
and O
their O
support S-POS
is O
great O
PUNCT O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
if O
their O
products O
were O
more O
reliable O
to O
justify O
the O
premium O
PUNCT O

in O
the O
three O
years O
i O
've O
had O
my O
macbook O
pro O
PUNCT O
i O
have O
never O
had O
a O
virus O
on O
my O
computer O
PUNCT O
and O
i O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
on O
the O
internet O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
ready O
to O
take O
it O
back O
for O
a O
refund O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
geek B-POS
squad E-POS
camed O
through O
and O
pointed O
me O
in O
the O
right O
direction O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
had O
laptops O
in O
the O
past O
and O
i O
thought O
why O
not O
give O
these O
small O
netbooks O
a O
try O
PUNCT O

it O
ca O
n't O
get O
any O
better O
PUNCT O

all O
the O
problems O
i O
have O
had O
with O
pc O
's O
are O
solved O
with O
a O
mac O
PUNCT O
the O
issue O
of O
overheating-my O
dell O
was O
always O
overheating O
and O
not O
working O
properly O
or O
simply O
shutting O
off O

and O
the O
issue O
of O
viruses O
and O
contaminants-my O
hp O
completely O
quit O
working O
within2 O
years O
of O
purchasing O
it O
PUNCT O
with O
no O
inexpensive O
way O
of O
fixing O
it O
PUNCT O

only O
good O
thing O
is O
the O
graphics B-POS
quality E-POS
PUNCT O

the O
other O
lock-up O
problems O
are O
from O
a O
myriad O
of O
causes O
PUNCT O
the O
most O
common O
being O
a O
corrupted O
version O
of O
appleworks S-NEG
which O
can O
render O
the O
browser S-NEG
useless O
PUNCT O

in O
short O
i O
would O
never O
buy O
a O
compaq O
again O
PUNCT O

the O
paint S-NEG
wears O
off O
easily O
due O
to O
the O
keyboard S-NEG
being O
farther O
back O
than O
usual O
PUNCT O

that O
's O
right O
PUNCT O
no O
power O
PUNCT O
absolutely O
nothing O
PUNCT O

i O
had O
purchased O
it O
from O
a O
major O
electronics O
store O
and O
took O
it O
to O
their O
service B-NEU
department E-NEU
to O
find O
out O
what O
the O
problem O
was O
PUNCT O

the O
store O
honored O
their O
warrenty S-POS
and O
made O
the O
comment O
that O
they O
do O
n't O
even O
recommend O
the O
hp O
brand O
because O
of O
the O
problems O
with O
their O
warrenty S-POS
PUNCT O

but O
i O
was O
wrong O
PUNCT O

no O
good O
PUNCT O

i O
always O
use O
a O
backup O
hard B-NEU
disk E-NEU
to O
store O
important O
files O
at O
all O
times O
PUNCT O

but O
the O
screen B-POS
size E-POS
is O
not O
that O
bad O
for O
email O
and O
web B-NEU
browsing E-NEU
PUNCT O

once O
i O
removed O
all O
the O
software S-NEG
the O
laptop O
loads S-NEU
in O
15-20 O
seconds O
PUNCT O

on O
my O
powerbook O
g4 O
i O
would O
never O
use O
the O
trackpad S-NEG
i O
would O
use O
an O
external B-NEU
mouse E-NEU
because O
i O
did O
n't O
like O
the O
trackpad S-NEG
PUNCT O

this O
computer O
does O
n't O
do O
that O
well O
with O
certain O
games S-NEG
it O
ca O
n't O
play O
some O
and O
it O
becomes O
too O
hot O
while O
playing O
games S-NEG
PUNCT O

obviously O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
features S-NEU
of O
any O
computer O
is O
the O
human B-NEU
interface E-NEU
PUNCT O

the O
body S-NEG
is O
a O
bit O
cheaply O
made O
so O
it O
will O
be O
interesting O
to O
see O
how O
long O
it O
holds O
up O
PUNCT O

the O
i5 S-NEG
blows O
my O
desktop O
out O
of O
the O
water O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
rendering O

PUNCT O

with O
a O
mac O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
antivirus B-NEU
software E-NEU
or O
firewall S-NEU
PUNCT O
it O
's O
so O
wonderful O
PUNCT O

for O
the O
use O
it O

a O
good O

PUNCT O

am O
very O
glad O
i O
bought O
it O
PUNCT O
great O
netbook O
PUNCT O
low O
price S-POS
PUNCT O

obviously O
PUNCT O
this O
macbook O
is O
p-e-r-f-e-c-t O
for O
me O
because O
it O
does O
exactly O
what O
i O
need O
in O
an O
easy-to-function O
way O
PUNCT O

worth O
the O
investment O
and O
truly O
a O
fine O
piece O
of O
equipment O
PUNCT O

the O
apple B-POS
team E-POS
also O
assists O
you O
very O
nicely O
when O
choosing O
which O
computer O
is O
right O
for O
you O
PUNCT O

the O
video B-NEG
chat E-NEG
is O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
is O
iffy O
about O
it O
but O
im O
sure O
once O
they O
unpdate O
the O
next O
version O
on O
the O
macbook O
book O
the O
quality O
of O
it O
will O
be O
better O
PUNCT O

you O
'll O
need O
to O
upgrade O
and O
pay O
a O
little O
more O
for O
them O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
hard O
to O
fix O
and O
makes O
it O
a O
hassle O
to O
own O

PUNCT O

i O
use O

all O

the O

PUNCT O
the O
way O
it O
takes O
a O

PUNCT O
how O

and O
most O

all O
how O
you O
do O

PUNCT O

wasted O

8 O

which O
gets O
hot O

the O

make O
it O

PUNCT O

i O
've O
had O
to O
call O
apple B-POS

have O
had O
wonderful O
experiences O

english O
speaking O
from O
vancouver O
techs S-POS
that O
walked O
me O
through O
the O

PUNCT O

but O
sony O
said O
we O
could O
send O

be O
charged O
for O
adding B-NEG
the I-NEG

an O

seventy O

PUNCT O

by O
this O
time O
i O
was O
regretting O
ever O
seeing O
this O

on O
the O

PUNCT O

toshiba O
is O
a O
great O

PUNCT O
even O
though O
i O

had O
it O
for O
a O
long O
time O
PUNCT O
i O
am O
very O
happy O
with O

PUNCT O

i O
need O
graphic B-NEU

run O
my O
adobe B-NEU
creative I-NEU

efficiently O
PUNCT O

the O
programs S-POS

esay O
to O

this O

works O
like O
a O

PUNCT O

the O
materials S-NEG
that O
came O
with O
the O

did O
not O
include O
the O
right O
PUNCT O
anywhere O
PUNCT O

so O
when O
you O
do O
call O
to O
complain O
about O
the O
hunk O

you O
get O
the O
joy O
of O

a O

you O
ca O
n't O
understand O
PUNCT O

that O
day O
PUNCT O

for O
one O
PUNCT O
i O
noticed O
that O
from O
turning O

my O

only O
took O
about O
25 O
seconds O
PUNCT O

it O
does O
not O
even O
have O
the O

to O
play O
a O

now O
PUNCT O

my O
brother O
is O
a O
computer O
wiz O
and O
would O
laugh O
at O
me O
because O
he O
used O
an O
apple O
PUNCT O

since O
i O
never O
really O
got O
to O
use O
this O
PUNCT O
i O
ca O

what O
went O
wrong O
after O
trying O
2 O
of O
them O
PUNCT O

buyers O
beware O
PUNCT O

how O
does O
the O

not O

PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

sells O
for O
the O
same O
as O
a O
netbook O
without O
sacrificing O
size S-POS
PUNCT O

i O
'll O
rather O
be O
out O
of O
date O
then O
spend O
more O
money O
on O
toshiba O
PUNCT O

windows B-NEG
xp I-NEG
sp2 E-NEG
caused O
many O
problems O
on O
the O
computer O
PUNCT O
so O
i O
had O
to O
remove O
it O
PUNCT O

love O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
reloaded O
with O
windows B-NEG
7 I-NEG
ultimate E-NEG
PUNCT O
and O
the O
bluetooth S-NEG
and O

reader I-NEG
software E-NEG
would O
not O
load O
PUNCT O

none O
of O
the O
techs B-NEG
at I-NEG

knew O
what O
they O
were O
doing O
PUNCT O

oh O
PUNCT O
it O
is O
such O
a O
great O
piece O
of O

PUNCT O

this O
is O
my O
second O

the O
same O
problem O
PUNCT O
bad O
video B-NEG

unreliable O
overall O
PUNCT O
this O
will O
be O
my O
second O

returning O
this O
laptop O
back O
to O
best O
buy O
PUNCT O

i O
use O
that O
alot O
on O
my O
desktop O
PUNCT O
so O
i O
am O
adjusting O
to O
not O
having O
it O
PUNCT O

with O
awesome O
graphics S-POS
and O
assuring O
security S-POS
PUNCT O
it O
's O
perfect O
PUNCT O

this O
machine O
was O
a O
horrible O
experience O
PUNCT O

it O
runs S-POS
perfectly O
PUNCT O

very O
dissappointed O
becase O
i O
have O
had O
toshibas O
for O
years O
PUNCT O
and O
never O
a O
issue O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
have O
any O
creativity O
in O
you O
do O
yourself O
a O
favor O
and O
get O
a O
mac O
PUNCT O

congratulations O
asus O
for O
creating O
one O
big O
piece O
of O
dump O
which O
is O
my O
laptop O
PUNCT O

sometimes O
the O
screen S-NEG
even O
goes O
black O
on O
this O
computer O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
checking O
out O
this O
laptop O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
market O
for O
one O
PUNCT O

i O
recommend O
for O
word B-POS
processing E-POS
and O
internet S-POS
users O
PUNCT O

since O
i O
've O
had O
this O
computer O
i O
've O
only O
used O
the O
trackpad S-POS
because O
it O
is O
so O
nice O
and O
smooth O
PUNCT O

when O
the O
computer O
has O
been O
on O
for O
several O
minutes O
PUNCT O
it O
will O
occasionaly O
just O
go O
off O
by O
itself O
PUNCT O

a O
longer O
battery O
life O
would O
have O
been O
great O
PUNCT O
but O
it O
meets O
it O
's O
spec S-POS
quite O
easily O
PUNCT O

who O
could O
n't O
love O
a O
dvd B-POS
burner E-POS
PUNCT O
80-gigabyte O
hd S-POS
PUNCT O
and O
fairly O
new O
graphics B-POS
chip E-POS
PUNCT O
as O
i O
soon O
discovered O
PUNCT O
though O
PUNCT O
there O
is O
a O
reason O
for O
which O
similarly-configured O
sony O
and O
toshiba O
machines O
cost O
more O
PUNCT O
they O
use O
higher-quality O
components S-POS
that O
are O
faster O
PUNCT O
better-configured O
PUNCT O
and O
end O
up O
lasting O
a O
lot O
longer O
PUNCT O

falls O
into O
the O
case O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
something O
i O
would O
deffinately O
reccomend O
to O
someone O
PUNCT O

its O
fast O
and O
another O
thing O
i O
like O
is O
that O
it O
has O
three O
usb B-POS
ports E-POS
PUNCT O

mac O
computers O
automatically O
defrag O
each O
time O
you O
start O
your O
computer O
PUNCT O

that O
is O
my O
only O
complaint O
PUNCT O

the O
salesman O
talked O
us O
into O
this O
computer O
away O
from O
another O
we O
were O
looking O
at O
and O
we O
have O
had O
nothing O
but O
problems O
with O
software S-NEG
problems O
and O
just O
not O
happy O
with O
it O
PUNCT O

that O
system S-NEU
is O
fixed O
PUNCT O

the O
computer O
itself O
was O
fast O
PUNCT O
ran S-POS
smoothly O
PUNCT O
and O
had O
no O
problems O
PUNCT O

one O
of O
the O
smartest O
thing O
i O
did O
was O
take O
my O
time O
to O
compare O
laptops O
before O
making O
my O
purchase O
PUNCT O

like O
the O
price S-POS
and O
operation S-POS
PUNCT O

the O
brand S-NEG
is O
tarnished O
in O
my O
heart O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
likely O
due O
to O
poor O
grounding O
and O
isolation O
between O
the O
components S-NEG
PUNCT O
and O
i O
'm O
hoping O
that O
it O
can O
be O
fixed O
with O
a O
ground B-NEU
loop I-NEU
isolator E-NEU
PUNCT O
but O
i O
still O
expected O
better O
product O
quality S-NEG
for O
this O
price B-NEG
range E-NEG
PUNCT O

honestly O
PUNCT O
this O
is O
absolutely O
wonderful O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
had O
it O
for O
about O
a O
1 O
1/2 O
and O
yes O
i O
have O
had O
an O
issue O
with O
it O
one O
month O
out O
of O
warranty S-NEU
PUNCT O

i O
really O
wish O
i O
had O
done O
this O
years O
ago O
PUNCT O

for O
example O
PUNCT O
when O
my O
husband O
turns O
the O
light O
out O
while O
i O
'm O
on O
the O
computer O
PUNCT O

once O
open O
PUNCT O
the O
leading B-NEG
edge E-NEG
is O
razor O
sharp O
PUNCT O

loaded O
with O
bloatware S-NEU
PUNCT O

if O
you O
buy O
PUNCT O
pray O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
major O
prolems O
PUNCT O

do O
n't O
get O
me O
wrong O
PUNCT O
i O
am O
no O
microsoft O
hater O
PUNCT O
i O
've O
just O
managed O
to O
turn O
into O
a O
much O
bigger O
apple O
fan O
because O
of O
this O
machine O
PUNCT O

hp O
refused O
to O
give O
me O
a O
new O
one O
and O
wal O
mart O
refused O
to O
take O
it O
back O
PUNCT O

within O
3 O
weeks O
the O
same O
issues O
started O
happening O
again O
PUNCT O

maximum B-NEG
sound E-NEG
is O
n't O
nearly O
as O
loud O
as O
it O
should O
be O
PUNCT O

well O
PUNCT O
they O
do O
n't O
care O
a O
bunch O
PUNCT O

great O
laptop O
for O
the O
price S-POS
PUNCT O
works S-POS
well O
with O
action B-NEU
pack I-NEU
games E-NEU
PUNCT O

although O
the O
price S-NEG
is O
higher O
then O
dell O
laptops O
PUNCT O
the O
macbooks O
are O
worth O
the O
dough O
PUNCT O

recommended O
to O
people O
as O
their O
first O
laptop O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
recomend O
this O
acer O
to O
parents O
and O
grandparents O
it O
can O
really O
help O
them O
in O
school O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
to O
anyone O
wanting O
a O
notebook O
expecting O
the O
performance S-NEG
of O
a O
desktop O
it O
does O
not O
meet O
the O
expectations O
PUNCT O

the O
macbook O
arrived O
in O
a O
nice O
twin B-POS
packing E-POS
and O
sealed O
in O
the O
box O
PUNCT O
all O
the O
functions S-POS
works O
great O
PUNCT O

so O
what O
if O
the O
laptops/mobile O
phones O
look S-POS
chic O
and O
cool O
PUNCT O
the O
after B-NEG
sales I-NEG
support E-NEG
is O
terrible O
PUNCT O

they O
have O
not O
sent O
a O
new O
one O
nor O
called O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
easly O
reccomend O
this O
laptop O
to O
a O
friend O
PUNCT O

i O
spent O
alot O
of O
money O
on O
this O
product O
and O
its O
been O
a O
nightmare O
PUNCT O

i O
also O
like O
the O
acer B-POS
arcade E-POS
but O
these O
were O
reallythe O
only O
two O
things O
i O
liked O
about O
this O
laptop O
PUNCT O

have O
not O
yet O
needed O
any O
customer B-POS
support E-POS
with O
this O
yet O
so O
to O
me O
that O
is O
a O
great O
thing O
PUNCT O
which O
is O
leaps O
and O
bounds O
ahead O
of O
pc O
in O
my O
opinion O
PUNCT O

thinking O
about O
returning O
it O

i O
gave O
it O
to O
my O
daughter O
because O
i O
just O
hated O
the O
screen S-NEG
PUNCT O
hated O
that O
it O
had O
no O
cd B-NEG
drive E-NEG
to O
at O
least O
play O
cd O
's O
when O
i O
wanted O
to O
listen O
to O
music O
and O
do O
schoolwork O
PUNCT O

it O
runs S-POS
very O
quiet O
too O
which O
is O
a O
plus O
PUNCT O

but O
it O
has O
a O
major O
design S-NEG
flaw O
PUNCT O

i O
took O
the O
laptop O
home O
and O
not O
even O
a O
month O
later O
PUNCT O
i O
began O
to O
have O
problems O
with O
it O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
heavy O
PUNCT O
bulky O
PUNCT O
and O
hard O
to O
carry O
because O
of O
the O
size S-NEG
PUNCT O

that O
was O
my O
first O
apple O
product O
and O
since O
then O
i O
have O
been O
incredibly O
happy O
with O
every O
product O
of O
theirs O
i O
have O
bought O
PUNCT O

i O
tried O
turning O
it O
done O
but O
it O
did O
nothing O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
super O
fast O
PUNCT O
and O
always O
loads O
PUNCT O

the O
games S-NEU
included O
are O
very O
good O
games S-NEU
PUNCT O

i O
bought O
mine O
from O

the O
day O
it O

released O

did O
n't O
have O
it O

PUNCT O

i O
had O
something O

go O

they O
said O
it O
had O
to O
be O

order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
buy O
the O
warranty S-NEG
PUNCT O

the O
whole O
experiece O
is O
horrible O
so O
save O
up O
and O
buy O
a O
better O

PUNCT O

i O
just O
bought O
this O
laptop O
3 O
days O

PUNCT O

sometimes O
you O
really O
have O
to O
tap O
the O

to O
get O

to O
worki O

it O
's O
super O

a O

it O
simply O

a O

i O
played O
down O

it O

the O

the O

it O

PUNCT O

no O

PUNCT O

i O
'm O
just O
really O
happy O
that O
i O
waited O
to O

because O
this O

kicks O
a O

the O

for O

PUNCT O
that O
makes O
it O
run S-NEG
way O
to O
slow O
PUNCT O

i O
feel O
that O
it O
was O
poorly O
put O
together O
PUNCT O
because O
once O
in O
a O

should O
note O
that O
i O
took O

now O
and O
i O
would O
say O
im O
pretty O
satisfied O
PUNCT O

the O
love O
part O
of O
my O
relationship O
with O
this O
laptop O
does O
n't O
take O
very O
long O
PUNCT O

not O
enough O
time O
for O
me O
to O
give O
it O
5 O
stars O
PUNCT O

the O
screen S-POS
shows O
great O
colors S-POS
PUNCT O

that O
's O
a O
huge O
difference O
PUNCT O

dells O
are O
ok O
PUNCT O
hps O
are O
n't O
that O
good O
PUNCT O
but O
macs O
or O
fantastic O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
totally O
satisfied O
with O
my O
little O
toshie O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
no O
idea O
how O
to O
burn B-NEU
cd's E-NEU
or O
to O
use O
the O
web B-NEU
cam E-NEU
PUNCT O
just O
for O
starters O
PUNCT O

again O
PUNCT O
i O
sent O
it O
off O
to O
acer O
PUNCT O
by O
this O
time O
they O
were O
paying O
for O
me O
to O
send O
it O
to O
them O
and O
everything O
PUNCT O
but O
it O
was O
still O
inconvienent O
because O
of O
my O
classes O
and O
my O
communication O
with O
my O
fiance O
PUNCT O

definitely O
recommended O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
extremely O
user O
friendly O
and O
intuitive O
PUNCT O

let O
me O
start O
with O
the O
good O
PUNCT O
so O
awesome O
PUNCT O

i O
had O
finally O
reached O
my O
limit O
and O
broke O
down O
PUNCT O

the O
17 B-NEG
inch I-NEG
screen E-NEG
is O
very O
large O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
computer O
is O
very O
light O
PUNCT O

my O
opinion O
of O
sony O
has O
been O
dropping O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
stock O
market O
PUNCT O
given O
their O
horrible O
support S-NEG
PUNCT O
but O
this O
machine O
just O
caused O
another O
plunge O
PUNCT O

for O
the O
bluetooth S-NEU
to O
work O
properly O
PUNCT O
you O
must O
install O
the O
launch B-NEU
manager E-NEU
on O
the O
drivers/applications B-NEU
dvd E-NEU
PUNCT O
or O
it O
will O
not O
show O
after O
the O
reload O
PUNCT O

i O
waited O
and O
waited O
and O
no O
laptop O
PUNCT O

everything O
is O
falling O
apart O
internally O
and O
externally O
PUNCT O

i O
also O
liked O
the O
glass B-POS
screen E-POS
PUNCT O

the O
switchable B-POS
graphic I-POS
card E-POS
is O
pretty O
sweet O
when O
you O
want O
gaming S-NEU
on O
the O
laptop O
PUNCT O

it O
super O
shiny O
PUNCT O
so O
you O
can O
see O
the O
fingerprints O
easily O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
not O
a O
wear-and-tear O
issue O
PUNCT O
not O
due O
to O
user O
carelessness O
and O
most O
importantly O
PUNCT O
they O
ca O
n't O
guarantee O
the O
problem O
will O
be O
solved O
if O
it O
is O
sent O
for O
service S-NEG
and O
i O
have O
to O
accept O
the O
outcome O
PUNCT O

the O
battery B-POS
life E-POS
has O
not O
decreased O
since O
i O
bought O
it O
PUNCT O
so O
i O
'm O
thrilled O
with O
that O
PUNCT O

when O
i O
called O
toshiba O
PUNCT O
they O
would O
not O
do O
anything O
and O
even O
tried O
to O
charge O
me O
PUNCT O
35 O
for O
the O
phone O
call O
PUNCT O
even O
though O
they O
did O
n't O
offer O
any O
technical B-NEG
support E-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
bought O
this O
notebook O
and O
only O
had O
it O
for O
3 O
months O
if O
it O
is O
overload O
with O
updates O
the O
boot B-NEU
mgr E-NEU
PUNCT O

oh O
and O
if O
thats O
not O
bad O
enough O
it O
does O
n't O
come O
with O
a O
recovery B-NEG
cd E-NEG
so O
you O
can O
make O
one O
if O
you O
know O
how O
to O
or O
buy O
one O
if O
you O
buy O
it O
the O
cost O
is O
PUNCT O
25 O
for O
two O
cds O
PUNCT O

the O
price S-POS
and O
features S-POS
more O
than O
met O
my O
needs O
PUNCT O

they O
refuse O
PUNCT O

big O
mistake O
PUNCT O

and O
dell O
and O
best O
buy O
both O
refused O
to O
take O
it O
back O
after O
i O
only O
had O
it O
for O
1 O
hour O
PUNCT O

my O
friends O
or O
children O
use O
that O
when O
they O
need O
to O
borrow O
the O
net O
PUNCT O
when O
i O
out O
grow O
this O
meaning O
when O
its O
old O
and O
my O
oldest O
child O
is O
ready O
for O
one O
she O
will O
get O
this O
one O
and O
i O
will O
be O
buying O
only O
toshiba O
PUNCT O

first O
of O
all O
PUNCT O
i O
've O
been O
dell O
fan O
for O
more O
than O
fifteen O
years O
PUNCT O

great O
investment O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
just O
amazed O
PUNCT O

i O
burned O
my O
leg O
PUNCT O
after O
lifting O
it O
from O
my O
desk O
PUNCT O
and O
for O
less O
than O
5 O
second O
putting O
it O
on O
my O
lap O
to O
clean O
my O
coffee O
table O
PUNCT O
so O
i O
can O
place O
it O
there O
PUNCT O

i O
thought O
all O
my O
problems O
would O
finally O
be O
solved O
being O
that O
my O
old O
computer O
would O
n't O
go O
onto O
our O
wireless O
network O
and O
i O
would O
n't O
have O
the O
same O
problems O
because O
it O
was O
updated O
PUNCT O

skype S-POS
is O
just O
so O
dang O
cool O
with O
this O
machine O
too O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
buy O
this O
lap O
top O
over O
and O
over O
again O
PUNCT O

the O
mouse B-NEG
buttons E-NEG
are O
hard O
to O
push O
PUNCT O

also O
PUNCT O
hdd S-POS
secures O
inside O
using O
rails S-NEU
PUNCT O
and O
there O
is O
only O
one O
set O
on O
the O
main O
hard B-NEU
drive E-NEU
PUNCT O

if O
you O
're O
not O
wanting O
to O
be O
mobile O
PUNCT O
this O
is O
a O
good O
laptop O
to O
sit O
on O
a O
desk O
PUNCT O

i O
also O
travel O
with O
it O
and O
it O
never O
gives O
me O
any O
problems O
PUNCT O

just O
do O
n't O
waste O
your O
time O
and O
money O
on O
this O
PUNCT O

all O
i O
will O
say O
now O
is O
that O
it O
was O
over O
two O
grand O
less O
expensive O
and O
so O
much O
better O
quality S-POS
than O
my O
hunk O
of O
crap O
vaio O
PUNCT O

beware O
PUNCT O
their O
staff S-NEG
could O
send O
you O
back O

you O
feel O
that O

PUNCT O

no O

PUNCT O

i O
have O
a O
lapdesk O
which O
i O

use O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
can O
still O
feel O
the O
heat O
through O
the O
foam O
and O
plastic O
PUNCT O

and O
its O
really O
cheap O
and O
you O
wont O
regret O
buying O
it O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
over O
rated O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
understand O
how O
anyone O
can O
think O
this O
is O
a O
great O
product O
worth O
purchasing O
PUNCT O

my O
sister O

she O
is O

PUNCT O

i O
was O
n't O
really O
sure O
i O
wanted O
to O
spend O
that O
kind O
of O
money O
PUNCT O

other O
thoughts O
PUNCT O
do O
not O
purchase O
this O
product O
PUNCT O

they O
say O
that O
this O
will O
invalidate O
the O
warranty S-NEG
on O
the O
hard B-NEU
drive E-NEU
i O
do O
n't O
really O
understand O
why O
but O
anyway O
PUNCT O

and O
looks O
very O
sexyy O
PUNCT O
d O
really O
the O
mac O
book O

is O
the O
best O
laptop O
specially O
for O
students O
in O
college O
if O
you O
are O
not O
caring O
about O
price S-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
took O
the O

in O
yet O
again O
except O
this O
time O
they O
kept O
it O
to O
send O
into O
their O
geek O
squad O
headquarters O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
a O
great O
laptop O
and O
i O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
PUNCT O

they O
definitely O

consider O
the O
ms B-NEG
office I-NEG
apps E-NEG

all O

PUNCT O
hope O
you O
have O
your O
own O
copies O
PUNCT O

they O
are O
wonderful O
PUNCT O
but O
very O
dangerous O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
emitting O
heat O
PUNCT O

this O
computer O
was O
awful O
PUNCT O

heck O
PUNCT O
if O
i O
had O
enough O
money O
PUNCT O
i O
would O
but O
it O
as O
a O
gift O
for O
someone O
PUNCT O

the O
battery B-POS
life E-POS
is O
amazingly O
long O
at O
7hrs O
and O
5hrs O
if O
you O
use O
it O
PUNCT O

my O
previous O

PUNCT O
excellent O
transition O

PUNCT O

the O
price S-POS
is O
another O
driving O
influence O
that O
made O
me O
purchase O
this O
laptop O
PUNCT O

the O
nortons B-NEG
virus I-NEG
scan E-NEG
is O
only O
for O
a O
very O
short O
time O
unlike O
others O
that O
usually O
are O
good O
for O
a O
year O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
stamped O
and O
not O
in O
pieces O
therefore O
it O
is O
a O
stronger O
more O
resilient O
frame S-POS
PUNCT O

i O
am O
first O
time O
mac O
buyer O
and O
am O
amazed O
at O
features S-POS
and O
ease O
of O
use S-POS
the O
mac O
offers O

two O
months O
PUNCT O

came O
fully O

PUNCT O
good O
PUNCT O

i O
noticed O
windows S-NEU
has O
a O
new O
system O
called O
windows B-NEU
7 E-NEU
PUNCT O
what O
about O
us O
vista S-NEU
users O
PUNCT O
they O
should O
get O
all O
the O
bugs O
out O
of O
vista S-NEU
before O
investing O
in O
a O
new O
system O
PUNCT O

when O
we O
bought O
our O
new O
hp O
comouter O
in O
dec O
of O
2008 O
PUNCT O
we O
wanted O
windows O
xp O
PUNCT O
but O
were O
told O
it O
would O
cost O
an O
extra O
PUNCT O
159 O
PUNCT O
so O
we O
went O
with O
vista S-NEU
PUNCT O

i O
definatly O
ca O
n't O
PUNCT O

files O
as O
well O
would O
become O
lost O
PUNCT O
deleted O
or O
corrupted O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
meant O
to O
be O
portable O
PUNCT O

my O
laptop O
worked O
again O
for O
just O
a O
while O
before O
i O
started O
having O
issues O
again O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
perfect O
for O
her O
field O
PUNCT O

taking O
it O
back O
less O
than O
24 O
hours O
of O
purchase O

the O
only O
thing O
that O
i O
have O
PUNCT O
is O
the O
key B-NEG
broad E-NEG
is O
a O
little O
dark O
to O
see O
the O
letters O
PUNCT O
would O
help O
if O
it O
was O
a O
little O
lighter O
then O
it O
is O
PUNCT O

hopefully O
amazon O
will O
take O
this O
back O
PUNCT O

they O
ended O
up O
keeping O
my O
computer O
for O
almost O
3 O
months O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
still O
within O
the O
one O
year O
warranty S-NEG
but O
the O
repair B-NEG
"depot" E-NEG
has O
deemed O
that O
this O
time O
it O
was O
caused O
by O
physical O
abuse O
and O
is O
not O
covered O
PUNCT O

but O
i O
needed O
a O
laptop O
for O
school B-NEU
use E-NEU
PUNCT O

he O
ca O
n't O
stand O
it O
PUNCT O

the O
computer O
was O
delivered O
as O
promised O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
the O
complete O
opposite O
to O
an O
ergonomic O
design S-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
would O
like O
at O
least O
a O
4 O
hr O
battery B-NEU
life E-NEU
PUNCT O

the O
only O
thing O
that O
i O
do O
n't O
like O
about O
my O
mac O
is O
that O
sometimes O
there O
are O
programs S-NEG
that O
i O
want O
to O
be O
able O
to O
run O
and O
i O
am O
not O
able O
to O
PUNCT O

looking O
online O
PUNCT O
many O
people O
are O
having O
the O
same O
problem O
PUNCT O

wireless S-POS
has O
not O
been O
a O
issue O
for O
me O
PUNCT O
like O
some O
others O
have O
meantioned O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
my O
second O
mac O
book O
pro O
PUNCT O

macbook O
notebooks O
quickly O
die O
out O
because O
of O
their O
short O
battery B-NEG
life E-NEG
PUNCT O
as O
well O
as O
the O
many O
background O
programs S-NEG
that O
run O
without O
the O
user O
's O
knowlede O
PUNCT O

all O
the O
things O
you O
can O
do O
with O
the O
trackpad S-POS
make O
navigating S-POS
around O
the O
computer O
and O
its O
programs S-POS
so O
much O
simpler O
PUNCT O
quicker O
PUNCT O
and O
easier O
PUNCT O

i O
guess O
the O
only O
good O
thing O
that O
came O
out O
of O
these O
were O
the O
speakers S-POS
and O
the O
subwoofer S-POS
PUNCT O

theres O
a O
built B-POS
in I-POS
camera E-POS
with O
special O
effects O
for O
video O
and O
photography O
PUNCT O

all O
for O
such O
a O
great O
price S-POS
PUNCT O

i O
went O
right O
out O
and O
purchased O
another O
laptop O
PUNCT O

long O
story O
short O
PUNCT O
since O
i O
experience O
so O
many O
problems O
with O
my O
laptop O
every O
since O
i O
bought O
it O
from O
day O
one O
PUNCT O
i O
did O
n't O
ask O
for O
a O
new O
laptop O
or O
a O
refund O
of O
what O
i O
pay O
for O
a O
crapy O
laptop O
PUNCT O
but O
just O
an O
extension O
of O
my O
laptop O
warranty S-NEU
for O
another O
year O
PUNCT O
they O
made O
a O
big O
deal O
of O
out O
that O
and O
after O
so O
many O
calls O
and O
complaints O
about O
their O
products O
and O
services O
PUNCT O
they O
finally O
gave O
in O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
able O
to O
play O
720p O
and O
1080p O
media O
files O
just O
fine O
with O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
already O
own O
an O
iphone O
PUNCT O
and O
so O
the O
move O
just O
made O
more O
sense O
PUNCT O

so O
think O
about O
factoring O
those O
things O
in O
when O
you O
purchase O
PUNCT O

took O
the O
netbook O
on O
a O
vacation O
trip O
and O
i O
was O
able O
to O
do O
whatever O
i O
wanted O
to O
do O
without O
lugging O
a O
much O
heavier O
laptop O
PUNCT O

everything O
was O
up O
and O
running O
within O
15 O
minutes O
of O
unboxing O
PUNCT O

this O
computer O
gets O
very O
hot O
PUNCT O
before O
shutting O
down O
PUNCT O

another O
thing O
is O
that O
after O
only O
a O
month O
the O
left B-NEG
mouse I-NEG
key E-NEG
broke O
and O
it O
costed S-NEU
PUNCT O
175 O
to O
send O
it O
in O
to O
fix O
it O
PUNCT O

went O
silently O
PUNCT O

satisfy O
what O
i O
paid O
for O
it O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
trash O
PUNCT O

clear O
picture S-POS
on O
it O
and O
everything O
PUNCT O

overall O
though O
PUNCT O
for O
the O
money O
spent O
it O
's O
a O
great O
deal O
PUNCT O

so O
you O
do O
n't O
get O
frustrated O
the O
first O
few O
weeks O
PUNCT O

they O
said O
that O
my O
computer O
was O
covered O
on O
an O
extended B-NEU
warranty E-NEU
PUNCT O
and O
that O
products O
with O
extended B-NEU
warranties E-NEU
are O
taken O
care O
of O
through O
third O
parties O
and O
not O
sony O
itself O
anymore O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
truly O
a O
desktop O
replacement O
PUNCT O

i O
only O
used O
it O

the O

way O
this O

functions O
much O
better O
PUNCT O

it O
lasted O
for O
many O
years O
of O
travel O
PUNCT O
kids O
and O
abuse O
and O
if O
i O
fired O
it O
up O
today O
PUNCT O
it O
would O
work O
PUNCT O

been O
a O
pc O
user O
for O
many O
PUNCT O
many O
years O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
never O
had O
any O
issues O
or O

with O
my O

when O

it O
PUNCT O

it O
freezes O
PUNCT O
and O
it O
always O
shows O
that O
there O
is O
an O

PUNCT O
so O
i O
have O
to O
restart O
it O
a O
few O
times O
every O
time O
i O
use O
it O
PUNCT O

however O
PUNCT O
my O

loose O
when O
you O

close O
the O

PUNCT O

it O

as O
soon O
as O

bad O
PUNCT O

ive O

the O
apple B-POS

the O
17-inch B-NEU

as O
well O
as O
the O

PUNCT O

its O

my O

their O

PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

i O
like O
this O
machine O
because O
its O
very O
lightweight O
PUNCT O

the O
features S-POS
are O
great O
PUNCT O
the O
only O
thing O
it O
needs O
is O
better O

PUNCT O

it O
was O
still O
working O
PUNCT O
but O
there O
was O
nothing O
on O
the O

i O
bought O
this O

PUNCT O

-called O

if O

PUNCT O
i O
would O
most O
definetly O
buy O
an O

one O
computer O
PUNCT O

the O
screen S-NEG
is O
framed O
by O
half O
to O
a O
full-inch O
margin O
that O
is O
obviously O
unnecessary O
PUNCT O
reduces O
the O
screen S-NEG
size O
and O
increases O
the O

PUNCT O

though O
the O

nowhere O
close O
to O

my O

i O
brought O
this O

last O
friday O
PUNCT O

originally O
it O
worked O
fantastic O
PUNCT O

the O
much O
lauded O
combined B-NEG
touch I-NEG
pad I-NEG
and I-NEG
clicker E-NEG
is O
a O
nightmare O
PUNCT O

the O
unibody B-POS
construction E-POS
is O
solid O
PUNCT O
sleek O
and O
beautiful O
PUNCT O

they O
're O
easy O
PUNCT O

will O
last O

i O
want O
my O

PUNCT O

i O
let O
my O

borrow O
it O

and O
she O
knows O
nothing O
about O

she O
used O
it O
with O
ease O
PUNCT O

this O
macbook O
is O
an O
outstanding O
product O
with O
great O
value S-POS
PUNCT O

if O
that O
is O
the O
case O
for O
you O
PUNCT O
i O
would O
suggest O
a O
pull-behind O
solution O
when O
looking O
at O
cases O
PUNCT O

i O
had O
to O
re-install O
windows S-NEG
within O
two O
weeks O
of O
the O
purchase O
and O
soon O
discovered O
cracks O
in O
the O
screen B-NEG
hinges E-NEG
PUNCT O

a O
second O
problem O
involves O
the O
battery S-NEG
which O
is O
advertised O
as O
having O
a O
storage O
life O
of O
11 O
hours O
but O
when O
fully O
charged O
shows O
only O
7 O
hours O
of O
service S-NEG
PUNCT O

and O
plenty O
of O
storage S-POS
with O
250 O
gbthough O
i O
will O
upgrade O
this O
and O
the O
ram S-NEU
PUNCT O

i O
had O
to O
call O
apple O
19 O
times O
each O
time O
40 O
to O
75 O
minutes O
on O
the O
phone O
PUNCT O
and O
take O
it O
to O
their O
store O
for O
evaluations O
PUNCT O
and O
diagnostics O
PUNCT O
5 O
times O
PUNCT O

no O
temporary O
replacement O
PUNCT O
they O
are O
out O
of O
replacements O
because O
many O
computers O
had O
problems O
with O
the O
nvidia B-NEG
chipset E-NEG
status O
of O

PUNCT O

i O
took O
it O
to O
friend O
who O
temporarily O
fixed O
it O
and O
i O
finally O
paid O
about O
1500 O
for O
the O
extended B-NEU

i O
respond O
that O
i O
do O
not O
have O
the O

PUNCT O

i O
homeschool O

with O

to O
my O

we O
get O
to O
teaching O

illustrating O
without O
skipping O
a O
beat O
PUNCT O

programs S-NEG
would O
crash O
all O
the O
time O
PUNCT O

it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
very O
unstable O
PUNCT O
unreliable O
laptop O
for O

PUNCT O

i O
bought O
this O

the O

time E-NEG
dose O

last O
as O
long O
as O
they O
say O
it O
will O
more O
like O
2 O
hours O

also O
PUNCT O
because O
of O
the O
size S-NEG
and O
consistancy S-NEG
of O
the O
laptop O
computer O
PUNCT O
some O
websites O
would O
n't O
even O
attempt O
to O
work O
on O
the O
computer O
because O
of O
browser O
problems O
PUNCT O

i O
work O
with O
kids O
and O
they O
love O
making O
short O
videos O
on O
there O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
very O
durable O
PUNCT O
i O
am O
pretty O
rough O
when O
it O
comes O
to O

and O
it O
has O
taken O
it O
all O
with O
no O
reprecutions O
yet O
PUNCT O

the O

have O
loved O
the O

trying O
to O

on O
another O

i O
find O
myself O
using O
the O

more O
than O
i O
thought O
i O
would O
PUNCT O

the O
macbook O
is O
a O
fantastic O
laptop O
PUNCT O

i O
believe O
this O
is O
because O
i O
was O
more O
active O
than O
the O
average O

PUNCT O
meaning O
i O
average O
about O
three O

PUNCT O

best O
buy O

PUNCT O

a O
couple O
things O
you O
should O
know O
PUNCT O

bought O
the O
first O
asus O

in O
san O

PUNCT O
returned O
it O
in O
santa O

PUNCT O
thinking O
it O
was O
just O
a O
problem O
with O
that O
computer O
PUNCT O

the O
screen S-POS
is O
bright O
and O
clear O
PUNCT O
the O
operating B-POS
system E-POS
is O
solid O
and O
friendly O
to O
a O

PUNCT O

it O
has O
a O
1 O

and O
a O

PUNCT O

the O
feature S-POS
are O
good O
enough O
for O
what O
i O
need O
PUNCT O

all O
the O
yada-yada O
PUNCT O

finally O
PUNCT O
the O
biggest O
problem O
has O
been O
tech B-NEG
support E-NEG
PUNCT O

this O
laptop O
is O
great O
for O
work O
and O
doing O
my O

this O
is O
n't O
a O

deal O
PUNCT O
i O

the O

PUNCT O

i O
love O
it O
PUNCT O

with O
windows O

a O

is O
an O
absolute O
must O
PUNCT O

i O
had O
been O
a O
windows S-NEU
user O
before O
this O
i O
love O
the O
size S-POS
because O
the O
screen S-POS
is O
big O
enough O
for O
what O
i O
use O
it O
for O
internet O
PUNCT O
artwork O
PUNCT O
and O
yet O
it O
is O
small O
enough O
to O
be O
reasonably O
portable O
PUNCT O

but O
if O
you O
're O
willing O
to O
pay O
another O
200 O

for O
a O

PUNCT O

very O
good O

i O
use O

a O

left O
it O
up O

figure O
out O
what O
to O
do O
with O
it O
PUNCT O

two O
of O
the O
times O

PUNCT O

although O
i O
was O
promised O
about O
10 O
hours O
PUNCT O
i O
found O
myself O
to O
a O
limited O
7 O
hours O
which O
is O
still O
amazing O
PUNCT O

it O
had O
the O
full O

with O
2 O

instead O
of O
just O
one O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
also O
cheaper O

made O

even O
more O
appealing O

PUNCT O

typically O
PUNCT O
when O

super O

set B-POS
up E-POS

is O
really O
easy O

PUNCT O

the O
only O
thing O
that O

is O
the O

the O
worst O
computer O
dell O
ever O
made O
PUNCT O

about O
1/2 O
of O
the O
sites O
i O
need O
to O
visit O
because O
of O
my O
work O
contain O
some O
type O
of O
flash O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
a O
great O
value S-POS
for O
the O

PUNCT O

it O
was O
a O
great O
laptop O
PUNCT O
ran S-POS
great O
and O
was O
really O
fast O

the O

to O
how O
awful O
it O
worked O
and O
how O
i O
was O
treated O
by O
the O
company S-NEG
PUNCT O

my O
review O
mainly O
talks O
about O
the O
difference O
i O
have O
felt O
between O
an O
early O
2011 O
and O
late O
2011 O
mac O
book O
pro O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
problem O
is O
a O
lack O
of O
screen B-NEG
resolutions E-NEG
PUNCT O

typing O
on O
the O
keyboard S-NEG
becomes O
uncomfortable O
after O
extended O
use O
due O
to O
the O
sharp O
edges S-NEG
that O
your O
wrists O
rest O
on O
PUNCT O

it O
has O
many O
great O
programs S-POS
PUNCT O
such O
as O
ilife S-POS
PUNCT O
iphotos S-POS
and O
others O
PUNCT O

other O
thoughts O
PUNCT O
received O
replacement O
16 O
days O
later O
PUNCT O

if O
the O
number O
of O
patrons O
in O
the O
apple O
store O
are O
any O
indication O
PUNCT O
hp O
and O
other O
pc O
manufacturers O
need O
to O
take O
note O
PUNCT O

the O
processor S-NEG
went O
on O
me O
PUNCT O
the O
fan S-NEG
went O
and O
the O
motherboard S-NEG
went O
PUNCT O

i O
bought O
my O
first O
macbook O
after O
seeing O
the O
product O
demonstrated O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
very O
well O
built S-POS
PUNCT O

might O
not O
make O
the O
avid O
gamer O
happy O
but O
i O
do O
n't O
really O
think O
that O
is O
what O
this O
computer O
is O
designed O
for O
PUNCT O

i O
highly O
recommend O
this O
laptop O
to O
anybody O
that O
wants O
great O
performance S-POS
from O
a O
laptop O
and O
would O
like O
to O
relax O
and O
not O
become O
enraged O
cursing O
the O
gods O
about O
to O
throw O
your O
laptop O
out O
the O
door O
PUNCT O

the O
screen B-POS
resolution E-POS
was O
exactly O
what O
i O
was O
looking O
for O
PUNCT O

even O
though O
it O
is O
running O
snow B-POS
leopard E-POS
PUNCT O
24 O
ghz O
c2d O
is O
a O
bit O
of O
an O
antiquated O
cpu S-NEG
and O
thus O
the O
occasional O
spinning B-NEG
wheel E-NEG
would O
appear O
when O
running O
office B-NEG
mac I-NEG
applications E-NEG
such O
as O
word S-NEG
or O
excel S-NEG
PUNCT O

seriously O
why O
have O
n't O
they O
just O
replaced O
it O
by O
now O
PUNCT O

there O
is O
no O
number O
pad S-NEG
to O
the O
right O
of O
the O
keyboard S-NEG
which O
is O
a O
bummer O
PUNCT O

after O
20-30 O
min O
the O
screen S-NEG
of O
the O
notebook O
switched O
off O
PUNCT O

if O
upgrade O
is O
possible O
to O
the O
full O
windows B-POS
7 E-POS
PUNCT O
then O
i O
will O
truly O
be O
a O
very O
happy O
geek O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
used O
both O
pcs O
and O
macs O
and O
i O
have O
to O
say O
that O
i O
really O
really O
love O
my O
mac O
book O
pro O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
originally O
concerned O
that O
i O
could O
n't O
view O
work O
i O
had O
done O
in O
college O
on O
my O
mac O
because O
of O
the O
pc O
formatting O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
was O
even O
more O
thrilled O
to O
learn O
of O
programs S-POS
like O
ilife S-POS
and O
iwork S-POS
that O
allow O
you O
to O
convert O
your O
pc O
documents O
into O
readable O
files O
on O
macs O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
a O
big O
big O
PUNCT O
but O
since O
it O
has O
a O
184 O
screen O
what O
would O
you O
expect O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
never O
had O
an O
experience O
like O
this O
PUNCT O

returned O
it O
to O
walmart O
PUNCT O

10 O
hours O
of O
battery B-POS
life E-POS
is O
really O
something O
else O
PUNCT O

i O
love O
everything O
about O
it O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
slow O
and O
one O
day O
i O
hope O
to O
have O
the O
money O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
it O
and O
buy O
something O
else O
PUNCT O

runs S-POS
fast O
and O
the O
regular B-POS
layout I-POS
keyboard E-POS
is O
so O
much O
better O
PUNCT O

all O
was O
well O
PUNCT O

all O
the O
programs S-POS
are O
easy O
and O
straight O
forward O
on O
my O
macbook O

PUNCT O
it O
is O
clean O
and O
organized O
PUNCT O
which O
i O
always O
strive O
to O
be O
myself O
PUNCT O

not O
worth O
it O
one O
bit O
PUNCT O

i O
just O
ca O
n't O
fathom O
that O
the O
celebrated O

would O
last O
a O

in O
environment O
of O
free O

with O
normal O

PUNCT O

through O

you O

to O
PUNCT O
i O
use O

just O
for O

PUNCT O

support S-NEG
has O
been O
lackluster O
and O
now O
i O
just O
want O
a O
refund O
PUNCT O

first O
of O
all O
PUNCT O
they O
had O
no O
record O
of O
me O
having O
the O

year I-NEG
warranty E-NEG
i O
'd O
paid O
almost O
PUNCT O
400 O

PUNCT O
and O
i O
had O
to O
call O
in O
PUNCT O
spend O
hours O
on O
their O
online B-NEG
chat I-NEG
service E-NEG
PUNCT O
and O
fax O
in O
multiple O

PUNCT O

i O
hate O
to O
say O
this O
PUNCT O
but O
if O
i O
could O
take O
this O
back O
to O
the O
shop O
and O
get O
my O
money O
back O
PUNCT O
then O
i O
would O
PUNCT O

it O
makes O
doing O
schoolwork O
at O

so O
much O
easier O
PUNCT O

being O
only O
2 O

old O
PUNCT O
i O

PUNCT O
iphoto S-POS
is O
probably O
the O
best O
program O
i O
have O
ever O
worked O
with O
PUNCT O
easy O
and O
convenient O
PUNCT O

i O
love O
to O
write O

play O
with O

my O
new O

works S-POS
great O
on O
both O
PUNCT O

this O
computer O
may O
be O
small O
but O
it O
is O
one O
heck O
of O
a O
power O
horse O
PUNCT O

they O
would O
repair O
one O
thing O
PUNCT O
send O
it O
back O
and O
it O
would O
still O
have O
the O
same O
problem O
PUNCT O

such O
as O
pages O
PUNCT O
numbers O
PUNCT O
and O
so O
on O
PUNCT O

my O
laptop O
now O
has O
no O
battery S-NEG
PUNCT O

beta O
had O
better O
quality O
PUNCT O
but O
vhs O
became O
the O
industry O
standard O
PUNCT O

it O
made O
the O
computer O
much O
easier O
to O
use S-POS
and O
navigate S-POS
PUNCT O

PUNCT O
-if O
you O
buy O
this O
PUNCT O
do O
n't O
go O
into O
it O
expecting O
7 O
hrs O
of O
battery B-NEG
life E-NEG
PUNCT O
and O
you O
'll O
be O
perfectly O
satisfied O
PUNCT O

needs O
longer O
lasting O

PUNCT O
more O
than O
1 O
to O
2 O
hrs O
PUNCT O

in O
may O
i O
started O

problems O
with O
the O
usb B-NEG
ports E-NEG
not O
working O
PUNCT O

10 O
plus O
hours O
of O
battery S-POS
PUNCT O

if O
only O
bill O

would O
read O
some O
of O
what O
is O
said O
here O

would O
do O
a O
better O

PUNCT O

the O

is O
awesome O
PUNCT O
quality S-POS
is O
unprecedented O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
going O
to O
try O
and O
keep O
my O
old O
g4 O
on O
the O
road O
for O
as O
long O
as O
possible O
PUNCT O

the O
mac B-POS
version I-POS
of I-POS
microsoft I-POS
office E-POS
is O
cheaper O
than O
buying O
the O
actual O
and O
works O
just O
as O
well O
PUNCT O

the O
mac O
takes O
about O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
starting-up B-POS
time E-POS
as O
the O
average O
pc O
PUNCT O
but O
keeps O
itself O
cleaned O
up O
and O
ready O
to O
use O
PUNCT O

its O
hard O
to O
encounter O
a O
problem O
on O
a O
mac O
that O
would O
require O
such O
abrupt O
action O
PUNCT O

the O
toshiba O
net O
book O
operates S-POS
very O
well O
PUNCT O

i O
loved O
it O
PUNCT O

the O
touch B-POS
pad E-POS
is O
fine O
PUNCT O
again O
PUNCT O
it O
's O
a O
real O
touch B-POS
pad E-POS
PUNCT O

it O
is O
also O
very O
lightweight O
PUNCT O
making O
transporting S-POS
this O
computer O
very O
easy O
PUNCT O

if O
anything O
PUNCT O
i O
would O
only O
suggest O
using O
one O
of O
these O
laptops O
if O
only O
you O
have O
to O
PUNCT O

i O
sit O
down O
and O
use O
my O
husband O

and O
i O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
one O
bit O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
wonderful O
for O
computer O
gaming S-POS
PUNCT O

and O
the O
best O
part O
is O
that O
it O
even O
comes O
with O
a O
free O
printer S-POS
when O
they O
have O
a O
certain O
promotion/offer O
going O
PUNCT O
of O
course O
PUNCT O

the O
place O
we O
bought O
it O
from O
said O
that O
after O
they O
send O
it O
out O
to O
gateway O
4 O
times O
they O
would O
give O
us O
a O
new O
one O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
very O
easy O
for O
anyone O
to O
use S-POS
an O
apple O
and O
specially O
the O
mcbook O
pro O
notebook O
PUNCT O

i O
like O
it O
better O
than O
my O
big O
dell O
laptop O
PUNCT O

the O
flaws O
are O
PUNCT O
this O
computer O
is O
not O
for O
computer O

because O
of O
the O
os B-NEG

PUNCT O

i O
tried O
giving O
it O
0 O

but O
i O
had O
to O
choose O
at O

one O
PUNCT O
but O
imo O
no O
stars O

they O
really O
do O
have O
the O
worlds O
very O
worst O
repair B-NEG
service E-NEG
PUNCT O

they O
need O
to O
stop O

to O
us O

customer B-NEG
service I-NEG

also O
able O
to O
install O
and O
use O
my O
photoshop S-POS
and O
aftereffects B-POS
programs E-POS
easily O
PUNCT O

for O
being O
so O
small O
it O
is O
amazing O
that O
it O
is O
as O
fast O
as O
it O
is O
PUNCT O

heck O
PUNCT O
i O
like O
all O
mac O
computers O
PUNCT O
but O
they O
're O
all O
way O
too O
pricey O
for O
the O
kind O
of O

the O
us O
is O
going O
through O
PUNCT O

they O
claim O
that O
i O
should O
be O
happy O
because O
i O
am O
getting O
a O
new O

to O
replace O
my O
two-month O
old O

PUNCT O

i O
'm O
already O
hooked O
on O
the O
sleek O

and O
dependability S-POS
that O
this O
laptop O
has O
shown O
PUNCT O

the O
machine O
itself O
is O
alright O
PUNCT O

it O
seems O
to O
have O
some O
opions O
that O
are O
intalled O
but O
do O
not O
work O
like O
i O
thought O
they O
would O
PUNCT O

and O
having O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
company S-NEG
has O
been O
a O
even O
worse O
nightmare O
PUNCT O

i O
will O
definitely O
be O
getting O
a O
new O
laptop O
if O
it O
has O
any O
more O
issues O
after O
the O
warranty S-NEU
expires O

researching O

so O
i O
do O
n't O
run O
accross O
a O

like O
this O
again O
PUNCT O

i O
also O
experience O
the O

with O
my O
macbook O

PUNCT O

it O
has O
all O
the O
features S-POS
that O

necessary O
for O

and O
if O
not O
they O
are O
able O
to O
be O
added O
onto O
the O

PUNCT O

i O
have O
owned O
many O
different O
brands O
of O
laptops O
in O
my O
life O
PUNCT O

i O
did O
an O
internet O
search O
and O
this O
is O
a O
very O
common O
problem O
with O
this O
laptop O
PUNCT O

i O
've O
owned O
this O
labtop O
for O
less O
then O
two O
months O
PUNCT O
already O
the O

other O
than O
it O

poor O

PUNCT O
overheating O
and O
occational O

PUNCT O

the O

is O
very O
intuitive O
PUNCT O
so O
much O
so O
that O
i O
never O
want O
to O
use O
buttons S-NEU
to O
click O
again O
PUNCT O

tons O
of O
bloatware O

PUNCT O

its O
sad O
because O
their O

are O
great O
PUNCT O

lots O
of O
extra O

but O
the O
keyboard S-NEG
is O
ridiculously O
small O
PUNCT O

luckily O
PUNCT O
dell O
said O
they O
would O
replace O
my O

with O
a O
new O
one O
PUNCT O
but O
instead O
i O
got O
a O
refund O
and O
bought O
a O

PUNCT O

i O
decided O
to O
get O
this O
pile O
of O
crap O
on O
a O
whim O
and O
totally O
freaking O
regret O
it O
PUNCT O

never O

PUNCT O

i O
think O
it O
was O
seventy O
nine O
plus O
tax O
PUNCT O

in O
summary O
PUNCT O
take O
your O
money O
elsewhere O
PUNCT O

the O

is O
very O
quick O
and O
effective O
as O
i O
load B-POS
webpages E-NEU

PUNCT O

my O
battery S-NEG
went O
bad O
about O
a O

and O
a O
half O
after O
having O
it O
and O
it O
cost O
around O
eighty O
to O
a O
hundred O
dollars O
PUNCT O

i O
will O
never O
buy O
refurbished O
again O
PUNCT O
i O
do O
n't O
cae O
how O
cheap O
it O
is O
PUNCT O

it O
pretty O
much O
does O
everything O
we O
could O
ever O

PUNCT O
and O
looks O
great O
to O

PUNCT O

bottom O

PUNCT O
i O
doubt O
you O
'd O
be O
overly O
disappointed O
if O
you O
invest O
in O
this O
machine O
PUNCT O

as O
a O
lifelong O
windows S-NEG
user O
PUNCT O
i O
was O
extremely O
pleased O
to O
make O
the O
change O
to O

so O
PUNCT O
owing O
to O
these O
problems O
PUNCT O
i O
went O
out O

got O
myself O
an O
apple O

PUNCT O
which O
i O
am O
using O
with O
great O
satisfaction O
at O
this O
very O
moment O
PUNCT O

the O

is O
extremely O
thin O

so O
this O
was O
great O
for O

the O

a O

PUNCT O

another O

PUNCT O

the O
macbook O
is O
also O
made O
better O
PUNCT O
my O
computer O
has O
never O
got O
a O
virus O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
laptop O
runs S-POS
just O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
first O
day O
i O
bought O
it O
PUNCT O

so O
PUNCT O
if O
you O
're O
thinking O
of O
a O

i O
would O
heartily O
recommend O

all O

PUNCT O
PUNCT O

i O
picked O
it O
out O
becaaspect0 O
it O
was O
inexpensive O
PUNCT O

and O
i O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
a O
good O
PUNCT O
easy O
to O
use S-POS
first O
laptop O
PUNCT O

the O
time O
remaining O
goes O
from O
4 O
hours O
plus O
to O
less O
than O
2 O
hours O
over O
the O
span O
of O
about O
10 O
minutes O
PUNCT O

pay O
attention O
to O
the O
specs S-NEU
if O
you O
want O
these O
options O
PUNCT O

stupidly O
PUNCT O
mind-numbingly O
slow O
-- O
then O
i O
found O
it O
can O
only O
be O
loaded O
with O
2gb O
*maximum* O
PUNCT O

it O
also O
does O
not O
have O
bluetooth S-NEG
PUNCT O

being O
a O

my O
whole O

PUNCT O

great O
battery B-POS
life E-POS
PUNCT O

the O
real O
stand O
out O
on O
this O
computer O
is O
the O
feel O
of O
the O
keyboard S-POS
and O
it O
's O
speed S-POS
PUNCT O

at O
first O
PUNCT O
the O
computer O
seemed O
a O
great O
deal O
-- O
seemingly O
high-end O
specs S-POS
for O
a O
low O
PUNCT O
low O
price S-POS
PUNCT O

delivery S-POS
was O
early O
too O
PUNCT O

during O
that O
time O
PUNCT O
i O
had O
to O
send O
it O
back O
3 O
times O
PUNCT O

although O
i O
opted O
for O
the O
lowest O
end O
macbook O
pro O
PUNCT O
this O
thing O
holds O
its O
own O
PUNCT O

and O
that O
probably O
explains O
why O
i O
've O
already O
had O
my O
sata B-NEG
controller E-NEG
go O
bad O
within O
a O
year O
of O
buying O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
my O
wife O
is O
also O
now O
the O
proud O
owner O
of O
a O
macbook O
as O
well O
PUNCT O

i O
've O
had O
a O
toshiba O
laptop O
in O
the O
past O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
also O
very O
capable O
of O
doing O
moderate O
video B-POS
editing E-POS
although O
you O
may O
need O
the O
performance S-NEG
boost O
of O
the O

for O

asus O
said O
my O
net-book O
was O
working O
properly O
PUNCT O

i O
received O
this O
laptop O
as O
a O
gift O
and O
let O
me O
just O
tell O
you O
that O
its O
the O
worst O
PUNCT O

very O
annoying O
PUNCT O

my O
main O
reason O
to O
convert O
was O
the O
imovie B-POS
program E-POS
PUNCT O

it O
has O
a O
faster O
processor S-POS
and O
more O
ram S-POS
PUNCT O

if O
you O
need O
an O
affordable O
PUNCT O
entry-level O
laptop O
PUNCT O
this O
will O
fit O
the O
bill O
PUNCT O

laptops O
are O
usually O
used O
on O
the O
go O
PUNCT O
so O
why O
not O
give O
you O
a O
better O
battery S-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
will O
never O
complain O
about O
the O
price O
since O
i O
believe O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
and O
my O
macbook O
pro O
was O
worth O
every O
dollar O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
n't O
a O
big O
fan O
of O
the O
netbooks O
but O
this O
one O
was O
very O
well O
designed S-POS
PUNCT O

it O
may O
take O
a O
little O
getting O
used O
to O
but O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
viruses O
or O
other O
headaches O
PUNCT O

and O
the O
warranty S-POS
on O
this O
macbook O
pro O
can O
last O
up O
to O
5 O
years O
or O
1000 O
battery O
recharge O
cycles O
PUNCT O

i O
still O
have O
that O
stupid O
bluetooth B-NEG
mouse E-NEG
to O
PUNCT O

would O
like O
more O
trendy O
PUNCT O
high O

PUNCT O

keyboard S-POS
is O

but O

could O
be O
more O
durable O
PUNCT O

screen O
is O
a O
bit O
glossy O
PUNCT O
but O
that O
's O
not O
too O
bad O
PUNCT O

received O
the O
product O
promptly O
and O
without O
any O
issues O
PUNCT O

i O
remind O
myself O
from O
time O
to O
time O
to O
take O
off O
my O
watch O
when O
ever O
i O
look O
at O
the O
small O
scratch O
that O
it O
has O
caused O
PUNCT O

i O
got O
it O
back O
again O
and O
was O
told O
the O
motherboard S-NEG
had O
been O
replaced O
PUNCT O
so O
i O
was O
now O
on O
the O
second O
motherboard S-NEG
within O
3 O
months O
PUNCT O

but O
reasons O
we O
chose O
this O
apple O
computer O
PUNCT O

processor S-NEU
PUNCT O
when O
compared O
to O
my O
3 O
week O
old O
early O
2011 O

there O
i O
barely O
experience O
any O
difference O
in O

23 O

v/s O
24 O

PUNCT O

they O
say O
it O
could O
be O
the O
motherboard S-NEG
again O
PUNCT O
but O
dell O

i O
upgraded O
from O
a O
5 O
year O
old O
laptop O
and O
was O
amazed O
to O
find O
out O
that O
this O
computer O
is O
much O
slower O
then O
my O
old O
laptop O
PUNCT O

2nd O
best O
computer O
in O
the O
world O
only O
one O
way O
this O
computer O
might O
become O
the O
best O
is O
that O
it O
needs O
to O
upgreade O
patches S-NEG
to O
make O
less O
easier O
for O
people O
to O
hack O
into O

love O
the O
speed S-POS
PUNCT O
especially O
PUNCT O

it O
could O
be O
a O
perfect O
laptop O
if O
it O
would O
have O
faster O
system B-NEG
memory E-NEG
and O
its O
radeon B-NEG
5850 E-NEG
would O
have O
ddr5 S-POS
instead O
of O
ddr3 S-NEG
PUNCT O

not O
only O
are O
the O
versions O
of O
these O
programs S-POS
able O
to O
be O
saved O
PUNCT O
worked O
on O
and O
opened O
on O
both O
a O
pc O
and O
mac O
PUNCT O
the O
versions O
of O
these O
programs S-POS
on O
a O
mac O
are O
graphically O
and O
functionally O
superior O
PUNCT O

by O
air O
sounds O
more O
like O
by O
truck O
to O
me O
PUNCT O

so O
far O
it O
has O
been O
five O
months O
since O
the O
last O
problem O
was O
fixed O
and O
i O
am O
praying O
it O
has O
finally O
stopped O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
outstanding O
too O
PUNCT O

the O
speed S-POS
gives O
you O
the O
power O
to O
work O
on O
these O
projects O
seamlessly O
PUNCT O
and O
multiple O
at O
a O
time O
if O
you O
sowish O
PUNCT O

awesome O
laptop O
and O
the O
perfect O
size S-POS
to O
carry O
around O
in O
college O
PUNCT O

so O
i O
'm O
disappointed O
in O
that O
because O
communicating O
with O
my O
relatives O
out O
of O
the O
area O
is O
a O
priority O
PUNCT O

a O
month O
later O
PUNCT O
we O
reinstall O
the O
os B-NEG
(vista) E-NEG
PUNCT O

some O
problems O
can O
be O
fixed O
if O
you O
purchase O
new O
software S-NEG
PUNCT O
but O
there O
is O
no O
guarentee O
PUNCT O

just O
chill O
and O
enjoy O
PUNCT O

the O
battery B-POS
life E-POS
is O
also O
relatively O
good O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
her O
first O
laptop O
and O
she O
is O
thrilled O
PUNCT O

i O
should O
have O
sent O
it O
back O
to O
them O
then O
PUNCT O

i O
definitely O
suggest O
getting O
an O
extended B-POS
warranty E-POS
PUNCT O
you O
will O
probably O
need O
it O
PUNCT O

if O
this O
would O
be O
your O
first O
mac O
purchase O
then O
i O
would O
highly O
suggest O
that O
you O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
class O
that O
they O
offer O
to O
learn O
about O
the O
differences O
between O
mac O
and O
pc O
's O
PUNCT O

this O
laptop O
leaves O
alot O
to O
be O
desired O
PUNCT O
i O
have O
had O
it O
only O
5 O
months O
and O
have O
had O
to O
send O
it O
away O
to O
be O
repaired O
twice O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
found O
it O
very O
easy O
to O
use S-POS
PUNCT O
very O
imformative O
PUNCT O
wonder O
alerts O
and O
tutorials O
making O
it O
very O
easy O
for O
someone O
like O
me O
who O
is O
not O
exactly O
technologically O
advanced O
to O
learn O
to O
use S-POS
the O
various O
features S-POS
and O
programs S-POS
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
have O
stupid O
pop B-POS
up I-POS
windows E-POS
even O
when O
i O
have O
pop B-NEU
ups E-NEU
blocked O
PUNCT O
i O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
wait O
5 O
minutes O
for O
a O
webpage O
to O
download O
PUNCT O
and O
best O
of O
all O
i O
can O
run O
all O
the O
web B-POS
programming I-POS
software E-POS
i O
need O
to O
use O
all O
at O
once O
without O
slowing O
me O
down O
PUNCT O

i O
bought O
this O
laptop O
so O
that O
the O
entire O
family O
had O
a O
computer O
in O
the O
living O
room O
PUNCT O

do O
n't O
waste O
your O
money O
or O
time O
PUNCT O

it O
has O
spent O
more O
time O
in O
repair O

than O
i O
can O
possibly O
recount O
here O
PUNCT O

memory S-POS
is O
upgradable O
PUNCT O

web B-NEG
access E-NEG
through O
the O
3g B-NEG
network E-NEG
is O
so O
slow O
PUNCT O
it O
's O
very O
frustrating O
and O
very O
disappointing O
PUNCT O

well O
PUNCT O
i O
bought O
this O
laptop O
a O
month O
or O
two O
ago O
PUNCT O

my O
macbook O

been O
a O

PUNCT O

the O

malfunctioning O
3 O
months O
after O

it O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
starting O
off O
good O
PUNCT O

the O

-do O

that O

PUNCT O

this O
is O
my O

i O
heard O
their O
customer B-NEG
service E-NEG
was O
lacking O
and O
that O
they O
were O
working O
on O
improving O
it O
PUNCT O

as O
well O
as O
having O
the O
plug S-NEG
in O
the O

come O
loose O
PUNCT O

very O
small O
and O
portable O
i O
've O
had O
this O

about O
12 O
hrs O
now O
and O
it O
's O
better O
than O
expected O
PUNCT O

not O
with O

PUNCT O

after O
3 O
pleasant O
weeks O
of O

the O

as O

PUNCT O
and O
i O
do O
think O
it O
is O
a O

this O
causes O
my O

enough O

setting S-NEG

the O

PUNCT O

it O
had O
some O

down O

pricey O
PUNCT O

also O
PUNCT O
the O
space B-NEG
bar E-NEG
makes O
a O
noisy O
click O
every O

PUNCT O

iphotos S-POS
is O
an O
excellent O
program S-POS
for O
storing O
and O
organizing O
photos O
PUNCT O

other O
than O
that O
its O
a O
great O
performing S-POS
machine O
and O
well O
meets O
all O
my O
needs O
and O
more O
PUNCT O

we O
were O
occasional O
mac O
users O
before O
PUNCT O
but O
most O
recently O
owned O
a O
budget O
pc O
since O
it O
is O
what O
we O
could O
afford O
PUNCT O

called O
tech O
support O
and O
got O
the O
usual O
acer O
we O
do O
n't O
support O
software S-NEG
but O
for O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
we O
can O
help O
you O
i O
explained O
there O
was O
no O
software S-NEG
involved O
in O
booting S-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
would O
never O
tell O
anyone O
to O
buy O
one O
either O
PUNCT O

the O
programs S-POS
are O
great O
PUNCT O
like O
iphoto S-POS
love O
the O
editing O
capabilities O
PUNCT O
imail S-POS
which O
can O
incorporate O
with O
the O
address O
book O
on O
the O
ipod O
and O
ipad O
PUNCT O
imovie S-POS
PUNCT O
etc O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
did O
n't O
learn O
in O
my O
research O
was O
the O
software S-NEU
i O
would O
need O
like O
privacy O
protection O
and O
warranty O
protection O
PUNCT O
in O
case O
it O
gets O
broken O
PUNCT O
or O
crashes O
etc O
PUNCT O

i O
ca O
n't O
say O
enough O
good O
for O
it O
PUNCT O

comfterbale O
to O
use S-POS
light O
easy O
to O
transport S-POS
PUNCT O

the O
computer O
itself O
is O
a O
good O
product O
but O
the O
repair B-NEG
depot E-NEG
stinks O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
tired O
of O
going O
without O
my O
laptop O
every O
few O
weeks O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
down O
fall O
is O
that O
it O
has O
no O
cd B-NEG
drive E-NEG
but O
i O
found O
that O
they O
are O
very O
cheap O
to O
by O
and O
also O
very O
portable O
making O
this O
the O
best O
friend O
to O
someone O
who O
is O
always O
looking O
for O
more O
space O
then O
they O
have O
PUNCT O

so O
PUNCT O
the O
hard B-NEU
disk I-NEU
capacity E-NEU
really O
does O
n't O
matter O
to O
me O
PUNCT O

keys S-NEG
stick O
periodically O
and O
i O
havent O
had O
the O
laptop O
for O
45 O
days O
yet O
PUNCT O

it O
crashes O
PUNCT O
and O
when O
it O
goes O
flat O
PUNCT O
it O
just O
dies O
like O
a O
pc O
PUNCT O
maybe O
worse O
and O
i O
loose O
all O
my O
open O
documents O
PUNCT O

i O
also O
like O
that O
you O
can O
scroll O
down O
in O
a O
window O
using O
two O
fingers O
on O
the O
trackpad S-POS
PUNCT O

everything O
from O
the O
design S-POS
to O
the O
os S-POS
is O
simple O
and O
to O
the O
point O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
now O
making O
a O
point O
to O
avoid O
their O
products O
and O
i O
hope O
my O
experience O
can O
serve O
as O
a O
warning O
to O
you O
as O
well O
PUNCT O

i'v O
spent O
as O
much O
for O
shipping S-NEG
as O
i O
would O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
netbook O
PUNCT O
of O
course O
a O
different O
brand O
PUNCT O

i O
personally O
like O
the O
gaming B-POS
look E-POS
but O
needed O
a O
machine O
that O
delivered O
gaming B-POS
performance E-POS
while O
still O
looking O
professional O
in O
front O
of O
my O
customers O
PUNCT O

when O
you O
look O
at O
the O
specs O
on O
apple O
products O
in O
comparison O
to O
a O
dell O
or O
a O
hp O
PUNCT O
yes O
they O
do O
seem O
to O
offer O
less O
for O
a O
higher O
cost S-NEG
PUNCT O

then O
i O
proceed O
to O
tell O
her O
that O
i O
checked O
out O
other O
retail O
stores O
that O
carry O
the O
netbook O
and O
it O
was O
n't O
like O
that O
PUNCT O

then O
they O
had O
me O
jump O
through O
many O
hoops O
and O
questions O
to O
see O
if O
they O
could O
find O
another O
way O
to O
invalidate O
me O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
downfall O
is O
the O
volume B-NEG
control E-NEG
PUNCT O

clearly O
PUNCT O
there O
is O
something O
wrong O
with O
the O
product O
and O
lg O
did O
n't O
take O
up O
the O
responsibility O
PUNCT O

very O
fast O
boot B-POS
up E-POS
and O
shut B-POS
down E-POS
PUNCT O

right O
out O
of O
the O
box O
PUNCT O
this O
little O
netbook O
did O
everything O
i O
asked O
of O
it O
PUNCT O
including O
streaming O
the O
everyday O
video O
you O
're O
bound O
to O
encounter O
checking O
mail O
and O
websites O
my O
biggest O
complaint O
previously O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
this O
laptop O
PUNCT O

this O
laptop O
is O
durable O
and O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
travel O
with O
PUNCT O

i O
finally O
decided O
on O
this O
laptop O
because O
it O
was O
the O
right O
price S-POS
for O
what O
i O
need O
it O
PUNCT O

what O
a O
mistake O
PUNCT O

if O
internet B-NEU
connectivity E-NEU
is O
important O
i O
would O
recommend O
going O
with O
a O
dell O
net O
book O
for O
50 O
bucks O
more O
PUNCT O
or O
buy O
a O
usb B-NEU
wireless I-NEU
card E-NEU
PUNCT O

i O
had O
read O
online O
that O
some O
users O
were O
having O
sound S-NEG
problems O
PUNCT O

my O
last O
computer O
PUNCT O
a O
toshiba O
PUNCT O
cost S-POS
only O
PUNCT O
400 O
PUNCT O
and O
worked O
like O
a O
charm O
for O
many O
years O
PUNCT O

it O
discharges S-NEG
too O
quickly O
PUNCT O

but O
to O
be O
honest O
PUNCT O
the O
compatibility S-NEG
issues O
and O
the O
other O
little O
quirks O
make O
me O
think O
i O
ll O
buy O
a O
pc O
next O
time O
PUNCT O

three O
years O
is O
a O
decent O
life O
PUNCT O
but O
this O
must O
make O
it O
to O
graduation O
and O
beyond O
PUNCT O

i O
work O
on O
a O
pc O
at O
home O
and O
have O
used O
pc O
all O
through O
college O
PUNCT O

toshiba O
will O
not O
acknowledge O
this O
problem O
PUNCT O

then O
it O
ceased O
charging S-NEG
at O
all O
PUNCT O

an O
absolutely O
hateful O
machine O
that O
no O
one O
should O
get O
of O
their O
own O
free O
will O
PUNCT O

PUNCT O
is O
a O
bit O
laggy O
PUNCT O
not O
the O
greatest O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
not O
much O
of O
a O
computer O
techie O
PUNCT O
so O
i O
can O
understand O
some O
of O
the O
internal O
problems O
PUNCT O
though O
i O
do O
have O
trend B-NEU
micro E-NEU
as O
an O
antiviral B-NEU
program E-NEU
PUNCT O

stay O
away O
from O

PUNCT O

the O
computer O
continued O
to O
give O
me O
issues O
and O
in O
late O
june O
it O
completely O
died O
again O
and O
i O
tried O
to O
call O

to O

fixed O
and O
they O
refused O

me O
PUNCT O
they O
said O
my O
warrenty S-NEG

PUNCT O

i O
've O
have O
n't O

with O

if O
the O

weak O
or O
not O
PUNCT O

i O
like O
it O
PUNCT O

the O
pricing S-POS

very O
competitive O
PUNCT O

so O
we O
got O
a O
good O
deal O
on O

for O
an O

we O
bought O
it O
for O
him O
PUNCT O

the O
advantages O
of O
owning O

numerous O
PUNCT O

i O
challenge O
anyone O
to O
show O
proof O
that O

25 O

i O
do O

PUNCT O

here O

that O

reason O
we O

we O

there O

and O
it O
comes O

that O
comes O

that O
makes O
the O
use S-POS
more O

PUNCT O

maybe O
not O
the O
cutting O

it O

but O
the O

PUNCT O

now O
the O

PUNCT O

either O
the O

solve O

PUNCT O

i O
was O
looking O

took O

PUNCT O

i O
have O
owned O

since O
2005 O
and O
this O
is O
the O
best O
yet O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
loving O
this O
netbook O
because O
it O
had O
an O
amazing O
screen S-POS
and O
display S-POS
and O
was O
small O
and O
light O
PUNCT O
but O
after O
1 O
week O
it O
stopped O
openning O
web O
pages O
for O
me O
even O
after O
installing O
new O
browsers S-NEU
then O
eventually O
it O
just O
started O
giving O
me O
a O
blue O
screen S-POS
and O
crashing O
everytime O
i O
booted O
it O
PUNCT O

now O
i O
could O
get O
myself O
a O
cheap O
computer O
PUNCT O
that O
will O
probably O
work O
a O
whole O
lot O
better O
PUNCT O

the O
so O
called O
laptop O
runs S-NEG
to O
slow O
and O
i O
hate O
it O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
the O
first O
laptop O
i O
've O
owned O
PUNCT O
althougth O
i O
used O
several O
at O
my O
previous O
job O
PUNCT O

those O
moments O
in O
thime O
where O
you O
want O
to O
throw O
something O
against O
the O
wall O
PUNCT O
yeah O
PUNCT O
i O
wanted O
to O
throw O
that O
lap O
top O
out O
the O
window O
and O
light O
it O
on O
fire O
PUNCT O

charger S-NEG
seems O
large O
for O
this O
class O
of O
computer O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
really O
have O
a O
complaint O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
pretty O
sure O
it O
's O
not O
newegg O
's O
fault O
but O
when O
you O
turn O
on O
a O
computer O
you O
just O
bought O
you O
want O
it O
to O
at O
least O
get O
to O

PUNCT O

best O
buy O
ended O
up O
junking O
the O
computer O
and O
giving O
me O
a O
replacement O
computer O
PUNCT O

i O
dislike O
the O
quality O
and O
the O
placement O
of O
the O
speakers S-NEG
PUNCT O

if O
i O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
any O
of O
my O
apple O
items O
i O
make O
an O
appointment O
at O
one O
of O
my O
local O
stores O
and O
they O
work O
on O
correcting O
it O
right O
there O
PUNCT O

so O
i O
called O
customer B-POS
support E-POS
which O
is O
good O
too O
and O
they O
went O
through O
it O
and O
it O
is O
just O
a O
safety B-NEU
feature E-NEU
and O
it O
does O
not O
affect O
performance S-NEU
at O
all O
PUNCT O
i O
just O
chose O
to O
hide O
the O
message O
PUNCT O

i O
claim O
that O
this O
has O
no O
value O
to O
me O
PUNCT O
the O
laptop O
was O
new O
anyway O
PUNCT O

enough O
said O
PUNCT O

not O
working O
PUNCT O
bad O

i O
would O
really O
recommend O
to O
any O
person O
out O
there O
to O
get O
this O
laptop O
cause O
its O
really O
worth O
it O
PUNCT O

otherwise O
this O
little O
notebook O
has O
met O
all O
my O
expectations O
PUNCT O

my O
son O
said O
it O
popped O
up O
and O
he O
clicked O
update O
PUNCT O

i O
lost O
two O
items O
i O
was O
working O
on O
until O
i O
figured O
out O
what O
was O
happening O
PUNCT O

the O
unibody B-POS
design E-POS
is O
edgy O
and O
durable O
PUNCT O

stopped O
booting B-NEG
up E-NEG
less O
than O
a O
week O
after O
my O
one-year B-NEU
warranty E-NEU
was O
up O
PUNCT O

but O
PUNCT O
for O
the O
cost S-POS
this O
is O
a O
winner O
PUNCT O

let O
me O
tell O
you O
PUNCT O
this O
machine O
is O
great O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
used O
a O
computer O
at O
work O
but O
having O
your O
own O
personal O
laptop O
is O
awsome O
PUNCT O

later O
it O
held O
zero O
charge S-NEG
and O
its O
replacement O
worked O
for O
less O
than O
three O
months O
PUNCT O

the O
second O
issue O
i O
had O
with O
it O
occured O
a O
month O
later O
and O
it O
kept O
overheating O
PUNCT O
even O
if O
on O
for O
less O
than O
an O
hour O
PUNCT O

also O
PUNCT O
the O
battery S-NEG
does O
not O
last O
very O
long O
at O
all O
PUNCT O

good O
luck O
with O
your O
purchase O
options O
PUNCT O

buy O
this O
if O
you O
like O
being O
tortured O
PUNCT O
teased O
PUNCT O
frustrated O
and O
wasting O
twice O
as O
much O
time O
as O
you O
spent O
using O
your O
old O
mac O
PUNCT O

very O
disappointed O
PUNCT O

they O
are O
asking O
me O
to O
ship O
the O
unit O
back O
to O
fix O
it O
at O
their O
site O
PUNCT O

i O
bought O
it O
from O
hsn O
because O
it O
was O
bundled O
with O
extra O
software S-NEG
PUNCT O
but O
as O
it O
turns O
out O
PUNCT O
that O
software S-NEG
just O
crashes O
it O
more O
often O
PUNCT O

i O
looked O
around O
and O
based O
off O
my O
price S-NEU
comparison O
from O
a O
brand O
i O
trusted O
i O
landed O
here O
PUNCT O

i O
constantly O
had O
to O
send O
my O
laptop O
in O
for O
services S-NEG
every O
3 O
months O
and O
it O
always O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
same O
problem O
that O
they O
said O
they O
had O
already O
fixed O
PUNCT O

unless O
you O
need O
the O
bluetooth B-NEU
3 E-NEU
PUNCT O

i O
was O
sorly O
disapointed O
to O
discover O
that O
hp O
what O
i O
thought O
was O
a O
reputable O
company O
would O
n't O
honor O
the O
warrenty S-NEG
when O
the O
fan B-NEG
blade E-NEG
fell O
apart O
PUNCT O

that O
is O
pretty O
sad O
when O
they O
name O
them O
specifically O
PUNCT O

more O
times O
that O
not O
the O
screen O
pops O
up O
saying O
i O
have O
a O
bad O
internet B-NEG
connection E-NEG
PUNCT O
or O
the O
page O
ca O
n't O
be O
displayed O
PUNCT O

no O
viruses O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
everything O
that O
i O
would O
want O
in O
a O
computer O
PUNCT O

do O
yourself O
a O
favor O
and O
invest O
in O
a O
few O
external B-NEG
harddrives E-NEG
if O
you O
are O
planning O
on O
purchasing O
this O
laptop O
PUNCT O

however O
PUNCT O
if O
i O
sound O
enthusiastic O
about O
this O
PUNCT O
i O
am O
PUNCT O

i O
give O
this O
laptop O
a O
five O
star O
review O
i O
love O
it O
and O
it O
has O
done O
chams O
for O
me O
PUNCT O

they O
removed O
them O
and O
returned O
the O
computer O
to O
me O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
understand O
why O
only O
windows B-NEG
7 I-NEG
starter E-NEG
is O
included O
PUNCT O

on O
3 O
july O
2004 O
PUNCT O

for O
about O

i O
went O
with O
him O
and O
we O
picked O
this O
one O
PUNCT O

while O
most O
people O
say O
that O
pcs O
hold O
functionality S-POS
and O
value S-POS
and O
macs O
are O
just O
pretty O
to O
look S-POS
at O
PUNCT O
i O
think O
there O
's O
something O
to O
be O
said O
about O
the O
simplicity S-POS
of O
macs O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
my O
second O
macbook O
pro O
and O
it O
's O
better O
than O
ever O
PUNCT O

my O
macbook O
is O
so O
much O
better O
looking S-POS
and O
so O
thin O
PUNCT O

the O
notebook O
would O
not O
turn O
back O
on O
again O
PUNCT O

the O
ease O
of O
use S-POS
is O
wonderful O
PUNCT O

this O
system O
came O
loaded O
with O
windows B-NEU
7 I-NEU
starter E-NEU
PUNCT O

-when O
battery B-NEG
life E-NEG
went O
to O

less O
PUNCT O
took O
it O
to O
the O
machouse O
amsterdam O
for O

26th O
of O
august O
PUNCT O

the O
battery S-NEG
gets O
so O
hot O
it O
is O
scary O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
so O
nice O
to O
look S-POS
at O
and O
the O
keys S-POS
are O
easy O
to O
type O
with O
PUNCT O

the O
apple O
macbook O
pro O
nothing O
to O
say O
butprofessionally O
great O
and O
outstanding O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
also O
very O
energy O
efficient O
PUNCT O
running O
on O
a O
quarter O
of O
the O
power O
it O
takes O
to O
run O
a O
60 O

PUNCT O

i O
am O
forever O
changed O
and O
will O
no O
longer O
buy O
a O
windows S-NEG

machine O
for O
personal O
use O
PUNCT O

mom O
PUNCT O
dad O
PUNCT O
brother O
PUNCT O
sister O
PUNCT O
you O
name O
it O
PUNCT O

but O
it O
came O
back O
in O
even O
worse O
shape O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
would O
change O
about O
it O
is O
the O
mouse B-NEG
keys E-NEG
PUNCT O

it O
is O
absolutely O
horrible O
to O
use S-NEG
PUNCT O
despite O
all O
its O
so O
called O
advanced O
features S-NEG
PUNCT O

before O
PUNCT O
i O
reloaded O
with O
windows B-NEU
7 I-NEU
ultimate E-NEU
and O
used O
only O
the O
downloaded O
drivers S-NEU
from O
acer O
's O
site O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
to O
keep O
turning O
it O
until O
it O
decides O
to O
lower O
and O
there O
is O
no O
mute S-NEG
PUNCT O

after O
that O
i O
turned O
to O

next O
vain O
help O
to O
get O
them O
to O
acknowledge O
that O
the O
warranty S-NEU
was O
still O
valid O
PUNCT O

so O
far O
PUNCT O
a O
great O
product O
PUNCT O

he O
loves O
it O
and O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
use S-POS
and O
well O
the O
schools O
start O
teaching O
the O
kids O
early O
about O
computers O
so O
it O
was O
easy O
for O
him O
to O
get O
started O
PUNCT O

u O
can O
do O
what O
u O
want O
in O
just O
few O
seconds O
PUNCT O
even O
to O
start B-POS
up E-POS
your O
computer O
takes O
few O
seconds O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
the O
most O
wonderful O
thing O
in O
the O
entire O
world O
PUNCT O

so O
i O
'd O
pop O
them O
off O
to O
see O
what O
the O
problem O
was O
PUNCT O
well O
guess O
what O
PUNCT O
the O
darn O
thing O
would O
n't O
go O
back O
on O
PUNCT O

also O
PUNCT O
macbooks O
come O
with O
much O
more O
features S-POS
which O
are O
so O
cool O
PUNCT O

they O
sent O
out O
a O

PUNCT O

they O
have O
developed O
excellent O
proprietary B-POS
software E-POS
for O

and O
i O
'm O
looking O
forward O
to O
utilizing O
these O

on O

far O
PUNCT O
using O

overall O
i O
would O
recomend O
this O
to O
anybody O

i O
also O
own O
an O

PUNCT O
nicer O

PUNCT O
and O
many O
other O

PUNCT O

the O
only O
downfall O
is O
the O

only O
last O
15-20 O

when O

the O
graphics S-POS

also O
stellar O

the O

PUNCT O
lack O
of O
a O

PUNCT O
its O
great O
PUNCT O

as O
a O
die-hard O
windows S-POS
enthusiast O
PUNCT O
i O
shunned O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
mac O
until O
this O
point O
PUNCT O

i O
think O
that O
if O
it O
is O
the O
motherboard S-NEG
again O
so O
soon O
that O
they O
should O
replace O
it O
PUNCT O

if O
this O
computer O
every O
breaks O
down O
on O
me O
i O
will O
most O
definatly O
get O
the O
same O
one O
again O
PUNCT O

i O
had O
a O
macbook O
notebook O
PUNCT O
and O
it O
had O
absolutely O
no O
protection O
from O

etc O
PUNCT O

the O

a O
1/10th O
of O
the O

i O
have O
all O
of O
the O

that O
were O
on O

PUNCT O

i O
made O
the O
right O
decision O
PUNCT O

in O
the O
past O
few O

PUNCT O
i O
've O
had O
terrible O
experiences O
with O

are O
clean O

internet B-POS

PUNCT O

the O
newer O
black B-NEG
keyboard E-NEG
took O
a O
little O
bit O
away O
from O
the O
previous O
gray O
one O
which O
looked O
really O
slick O
PUNCT O
but O
it O
is O
still O
a O
great O
notebook O
PUNCT O

sony O
parts O
reliability O
and O
quality O
of O
service S-NEG
is O
recenlty O
the O
worst O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
very O
happy O
PUNCT O

as O
with O
any O
laptop O
not O
purchased O
with O
software B-NEG
options E-NEG
PUNCT O
it O
comes O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
what O
i O
consider O
useless O
applications S-NEG
PUNCT O

its O
office S-POS
compatible O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
features S-NEU
and O
its O
functioning S-NEU
is O
all O
new O
again O
so O
you O
might O
as O
well O
save O
the O
money O
and O
just O
learn O
the O
pre O
installed O
mac O
programs S-NEU
PUNCT O

i O
occassionaly O
use O
it O
for O
work O
via O
vpn O
and O
it O
has O
not O
given O
me O
any O
problems O
PUNCT O

i O
sent O
it O
back O
and O
they O
lost O
it O
PUNCT O

it O
just O
works S-POS
flawlessly O
PUNCT O

do O
you O
think O
i O
purposely O
destroy O
my O
netbook O
PUNCT O
so O
that O
i O
can O
demand O
a O
new O
set O
PUNCT O
do O
you O
think O
it O
's O
fun O
to O
take O
public O
transport O
all O
the O
way O
to O
the O
service B-NEG
center E-NEG
and O
get O
a O
non-satisfactory O
solution O
PUNCT O
or O
rather O
no O
solution O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
having O
the O
laptop O
returned O
unrepaired O
since O
paying O
PUNCT O
176 O
every O
3 O
months O
just O
is O
n't O
worth O
it O
that O
's O
about O
how O
long O
the O
port S-NEG
seems O
to O
last O
PUNCT O

ok O
first O
PUNCT O

so O
if O
you O
move O
laptop O
a O
lot O
PUNCT O
it O
might O
get O
loose O
PUNCT O
however O
it O
sits O
pretty O
tightly O
PUNCT O

another O
satisfied O
customer O
PUNCT O

also O
the O
battery S-NEG
is O
completely O
shot O
PUNCT O

highly O
recommended O
PUNCT O

the O
biggest O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
box O
had O
no O
instructions S-NEG
in O
it O
PUNCT O

but O
after O
using O
it O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
PUNCT O
the O
overall O
operation S-NEG
is O
poor O
PUNCT O

will O
not O
buy O
another O
toshiba O
PUNCT O
this O
is O
my O
second O
PUNCT O
not O
happy O
w/ O
either O
PUNCT O

for O
two O
months O
PUNCT O
when O
you O
guessed O
it O
PUNCT O

this O
was O
my O
first O
macbook O
purchase O
ever O
PUNCT O

screen S-POS
is O
crystal O
clear O
and O
the O
system S-POS
is O
very O
responsive O
PUNCT O

i O
will O
stack O
it O
up O
against O
laptops O
that O
cost O
twice O
as O
much O
any O
day O
PUNCT O

quite O
simply O
this O
is O
the O
best O
laptop O
i O
have O
ever O
owned O
PUNCT O

or O
the O
cursor S-NEG
would O
show O
up O
some O
place O
else O
PUNCT O

the O
newer O
macbook O
that O
i O
have O
purchased O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
computers O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
had O
some O
excellent O
computer O
and O
have O
found O
i O
had O
no O
idea O
what O
to O
do O
with O
them O

as O
it O
turns O
out O
PUNCT O
i O
just O
did O
n't O
know O
any O
better O
PUNCT O

i O
've O
had O
friends O
with O

who O
seem O
to O
have O
had O
similar O
or O
exact O
same O
problems O
PUNCT O

what O
can O
i O
say O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
easy O
to O
operate S-POS
and O
i O
have O
already O
ordered O
more O
software S-NEU
and O
gadgets S-NEU
for O
my O
new O
rolls O
royce O
of O
laptops O
PUNCT O

what O
's O
also O
interesting O
is O
this O

changed O
my O

the O
first O
time O
i O

several O

awesome O

totally O

maybe O
definitely O
obsessed O

it O
PUNCT O

the O

long O

the O

so O
worth O
it O
PUNCT O

it O
quit O

after O
i O
got O

PUNCT O

overall O
PUNCT O
i O
experienced O
a O
huge O
change O
in O
that O
my O

runs S-POS
pretty O
fast O
compared O
to O
my O
old O

when O

PUNCT O

it O
also O
came O
with O
a O
built B-POS
it I-POS
web I-POS

because O

good O

both O
were O
resolved O
by O

easily O

although O
my O

was O
listed O
as O
recalled O
PUNCT O

denied O
my O

PUNCT O

i O
was O
a O
little O
weary O
at O
purchasing O
another O
13 O

almost O
2 O
years O

gotten O
its O
current O
line O
of O

cards E-POS
in O
order O
this O
time O
around O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
loyal O
to O

PUNCT O

they O
are O
by O
far O
the O
easiest O
systems S-POS
to O
actually O
learn O
about O

with O
PUNCT O

i O
will O
be O
patient O
for O
few O

PUNCT O

this O
apple O
navigates O
you O
thru O
the O
unexplored O
world O
of O
the O

PUNCT O

this O
was O
purchased O
for O
my O

i O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
PUNCT O

finally O
set O
the O

back O
to O

after O
a O
month O
of O
hell O
PUNCT O

i O
could O
n't O
afford O
a O
new O
mac O
PUNCT O
so O
i O
bought O
a O
pc O
instead O
PUNCT O

the O
video O
card O
is O
great O
for O

PUNCT O
and O
above O
average O
for O

PUNCT O
but O
not O
a O
gamers O
first O
choice O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
always O
getting O
froze O
up O
PUNCT O

my O
information O
was O
all O
lost O
my O

PUNCT O
i O
know O
PUNCT O

i O
never O
thought O
i O
would O
need O
to O
back O
up O
my O
information O
on O
a O
brand O
new O
mac O
PUNCT O
the O
paragon O

but O
no O

PUNCT O

i O
got O
the O

PUNCT O

this O

the O

PUNCT O

apple O

PUNCT O

i O
had O
of O
course O
bought O
a O
3 B-NEU

PUNCT O
so O
i O
sent O
it O
in O

and O
almost O
2 O
months O
later O
the O
dv4 O
is O
what O
the O
sent O

as O
a O

PUNCT O

apparently O
there O
is O
a O
manufacturing O
defect O
PUNCT O
something O
with O
the O

PUNCT O

despite O
the O
claims O
of O
the O
apple O
apologists O
a O
vice O
of O

i O
am O
recently O
myself O
reformed O
the O
internals S-NEG
of O
mac O

are O
no O
different O
from O

at O
this O
point O
PUNCT O

took O
several O
hours O
with O
customer B-NEG
support E-NEG
before O
i O
could O
even O
start O
the O
pc O
out O
of O
the O
box O
PUNCT O

windows B-NEG
vista E-NEG
makes O
this O
computer O
almost O
unusable O
for O
online B-NEG
service E-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
contacted O
acer O
and O
they O
are O
giving O
me O
free O
recovery B-POS

PUNCT O
so O
do O
n't O
go O
and O
pay O
for O
them O
PUNCT O
just O
ask O
for O
them O
and O
they O
should O
give O
them O
to O
you O
PUNCT O

now O
when O
i O
order O
i O
did O
not O
go O
full O
scale O
for O
the O
webcam S-NEU
or O
full O

i O
wanted O
something O
for O
basics O
of O
being O
easy O
to O
carry S-POS
when O
i O
use O
crutchs O
or O

PUNCT O

otherwise O
PUNCT O
all O

so O
in O
late O
march O
PUNCT O
early O
april O
2009 O
i O
was O
without O

a O
couple O

while O

i O
had O

my O

was O
in O
afghanistan O

was O
the O
best O

method O
we O
had O
PUNCT O

the O
performance S-POS
is O
awesome O
PUNCT O

i O
pondered O
very O
long O
over O
this O

PUNCT O

this O
thing O
sucks O
PUNCT O

i O
love O
my O
new O

PUNCT O

okay O
PUNCT O

just O
start O
out O

frustration O
PUNCT O

so O
i O
got O
another O

i O
love O
PUNCT O

but O
in O
fact O
it O
is O
totally O
the O
opposite O
PUNCT O

the O
display S-NEG
is O
beyond O
horrible O
PUNCT O

he O
left O
me O
PUNCT O
instructions O
on O
what O
to O
do O
when O
this O
comes O
up O
PUNCT O
or O
that O
comes O
up O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
a O

PUNCT O

there O
is O
hardly O
any O

on O
the O

's O
hard B-NEG

PUNCT O

actually O

PUNCT O

i O

PUNCT O

next O
PUNCT O
most O

but O
i O
do O

numerous O

over O
the O
next O
3 O

i O
need O
to O
wait O

it O

the O

my O

the O

sucked O

when O
the O

went O
out O
we O
were O
sol O
there O
to O
PUNCT O
so O
much O
for O
that O
warranty S-NEG
covering O
all O

i O
needed O
a O
new O
computer O
for O
graduate O
school O
had O
never O
owned O
a O
laptop O
before O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
only O
reason O
i O
did O
n't O
purchase O
a O
mac O
was O
because O
my O
school O
's O
website O
strongly O
recommended O
students O
purchase O
pcs O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
had O
another O
mac O
PUNCT O
but O
it O
got O
slow O
due O
to O
an O
older O
operating B-NEG
system E-NEG
PUNCT O

if O
you O
have O
the O
money O
i O
suggest O
going O
for O
the O
i7 O
PUNCT O

that O
's O
very O
possible O
PUNCT O
but O
since O
they O
do O
n't O
make O
windows B-NEG
xp I-NEG
drivers E-NEG
for O
the O
sound B-NEG
card E-NEG
in O
this O
machine O
PUNCT O
i O
was O
stuck O
until O
windows B-POS
7 E-POS
came O
out O
PUNCT O

i'ts O
nice O
to O
have O
the O
higher-end O
laptops O
PUNCT O
but O
this O
fits O
my O
budget S-POS
and O
the O
features S-POS
i O
need O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
PUNCT O
however O
PUNCT O
very O
heavy O
PUNCT O

was O
disappointed O
to O
find O
out O
that O
the O
model O
had O
been O
discontinued O
PUNCT O
apparently O
because O
of O
known O
motherboard S-NEG
problems O
PUNCT O

well O
PUNCT O
i O
started O
using O
google O
chrome O
PUNCT O
which O
is O
a O
little O
better O
PUNCT O
but O
it O
freezes O
too O
sometimes O
PUNCT O

also O
the O
speakers S-NEG
are O
not O
very O
loud O
PUNCT O
but O
it O
is O
a O
netbook O
PUNCT O

love O
this O
laptop O
wonderful O
price S-POS
for O
what O
you O
get O
PUNCT O

but O
PUNCT O
at O
the O
same O
time O
they O
the O
company O
would O
not O
and O
could O
not O
do O
anything O
about O
my O
problem O
PUNCT O

just O
a O
black O
screen S-NEG
PUNCT O

all O
you O
have O
to O
do O
is O
turn O
it O
on O
and O
it O
works O
PUNCT O

a O
key O
contributor O
that O
led O
me O
to O
mac O
is O
the O
art B-POS
aspect E-POS
PUNCT O

eventually O
my O
battery S-NEG
would O
n't O
charge O
PUNCT O
so O
unless O
i O
had O
it O
plugged O
in O
it O
would O
n't O
even O

PUNCT O

recently O
there O
are O
a O
few O
incidents O
that O
annoy O
the O
hell O
out O
of O
me O
PUNCT O

save O
your O
money O
and O
go O
for O
a O
better O
device O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
been O
a O
pc O
user O
since O
middle O
school O
PUNCT O
but O
in O
my O
mid O
twenties O
i O
decided O
to O
convert O
to O
the O
dark O
side O
PUNCT O
or O
should O
i O
say O
the O
brighter O
side O
of O
life O
PUNCT O

purchased O
for O
development O
purposes O
PUNCT O
but O
it O
has O
turned O
into O
my O
everyday O
laptop O
as O
well O
for O
surfing S-POS
PUNCT O
e-mail O
PUNCT O
etc O
PUNCT O

without O
having O
to O
have O
extra O
equipment O
and/or O
complicated O
routes O
to O
take O
to O
be O
able O
to O
do O
so O
PUNCT O

my O
first O
problem O
was O
with O
the O
pre-loaded B-NEG
norton I-NEG
firewall/security I-NEG
program E-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
had O
a O
usb B-NEG
connect E-NEG
but O
PUNCT O
i O
ca O
n't O
use O
it O
because O
it O
is O
not O
compatible O
PUNCT O

accordingly O
PUNCT O
i O
have O
decided O
to O
never O
purchase O
another O
hp O

my O
five O
year O

5-years O

i O
ordered O
four O
d620 O
laptops O
PUNCT O

i O
know O
that O
everyone O
thinks O
macs O
are O
overpriced O
and O
overrated O
PUNCT O
but O
once O
you O
get O
past O
the O
initial O
expense S-NEG
you O
'll O
find O
that O
they O
're O
worth O
every O
penny O
besides O
PUNCT O
there O
's O
always O
the O
financing O
plan O
that O
best O
buy O
offers O
PUNCT O

i O
saw O
this O
one O
PUNCT O
and O
i O
have O
the O
most O
difficult O
time O
trying O
to O
use O
them O
PUNCT O
they O
've O
made O
great O

collectors O
PUNCT O
i O
hate O
putting O
this O

down O

i O
love O
the O
multi-touch B-POS

PUNCT O

i O
absolutely O
love O
my O
mac O
PUNCT O

from O
the O
second O
you O
open O
the O

you O
will O
fall O
in O
love O
with O
this O
computer O
PUNCT O

hp O
is O
more O
interested O
in O
selling O
extended B-NEG

cost S-NEG
more O
than O
the O

then O
they O
are O
in O
helping O

PUNCT O

it O
would O
not O
let O

not O
too O
much O
junk O

is O
loosing O
about O
20 O
PUNCT O

took O
a O
bit O
of O

overall O
it O

worth O
it O
PUNCT O

it O

also O
extremely O

for O

PUNCT O

i O
agree O
with O
the O
previous O
comment O
that O
asus B-NEG
tech I-NEG
support E-NEG
is O
horrible O
which O
is O
a O
con O
in O
my O
opinion O
PUNCT O

in O
fact O
PUNCT O
somehow O
and O
i O
never O
opened O
it O
up O
some O
specks O
of O
dust O
or O
something O
got O
inside O
the O
screen S-NEG
and O
are O
now O
there O
permanently O
PUNCT O
behind O
the O
front O
of O
the O

PUNCT O
in O
the O

the O

on I-NEU
the I-NEU

PUNCT O
the O

PUNCT O

when O
i O
took O
it O
back O
to O

i O
asked O
them O
if O
they O
were O
seriously O
trying O
to O
drive O
me O
insane O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
tried O
to O
charge O

PUNCT O

i O
would O
recommend O
this O

to O
anyone O
searching O
for O
the O
perfect O
laptop O
PUNCT O
and O
the O

anyone O

suggest O
you O
look O
into O
buying O
a O
different O
brand O
PUNCT O

highly O
recommend O
for O

PUNCT O

not O

PUNCT O

the O
programs S-POS
that O
come O
standard O
with O

are O
enough O
for O
the O

to O
run O
all O
the O

PUNCT O

i O
am O
really O
heartbroken O
to O
have O
to O

PUNCT O

so O
what O
am O
i O
supposed O
to O
do O
PUNCT O
the O

can O
not O
provide O

the O

when O

the O

PUNCT O

the O
material S-POS
this O

seems O
a O
lot O
nicer O
than O
any O
pc O
specs S-NEG
PUNCT O
like O
i O
said O
this O
performs S-POS
a O
lot O
better O
than O
any O
computer O
i O
've O
had O
in O
the O
past O
PUNCT O

it O
has O
been O
nothing O
but O
trouble O
from O
the O
time O
we O
bought O
it O
PUNCT O

after O
doing O
extensive O
research O
PUNCT O
macconnection O
had O
the O
lowest O
price S-POS
on O
the O

mbp O

PUNCT O

i O
am O
addicted O
to O
photo B-POS
booth E-POS
PUNCT O

the O
operating B-POS
system E-POS
and O
user B-POS
interface E-POS
is O
very O
intuitive O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
large O
multi-touch B-POS
track I-POS

is O
amazing O
PUNCT O

so O
PUNCT O
i O
went O
back O
PUNCT O

i O
like O
it O
so O
much O
PUNCT O
i O
bought O
another O
just O
for O
my O
wife O
PUNCT O

i O
took O
it O
back O
to O
the O
store O
and O
exchanged O
it O
for O
another O
one O
PUNCT O

all O
in O
all O
great O
item O
highly O
recommend O
it O
PUNCT O

hard B-NEU
disk E-NEU
PUNCT O
the O
new O
editions O
gives O
you O
more O
hard B-POS
disk I-POS
space E-POS
500gb O
instead O
of O
320gb O
but O
time O
has O
taught O
me O
never O
to O
trust O
an O
internal B-NEU
hard I-NEU
disk E-NEU
PUNCT O

this O
laptop O
rocks O
only O
wish O
it O
could O
run O
solidworks O
cad O
PUNCT O
which O
apple O
does O
n't O
support O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
extremely O
portable O
and O
easily O
connects B-POS
to I-POS
wifi E-POS
at O
the O
library O
and O
elsewhere O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
have O
that O
additional O
money O
right O
now O
PUNCT O
and O
therefore O
would O
n't O
have O
purchased O
it O
at O
this O
time O
PUNCT O

first O
things O
first O
PUNCT O
macbook O
pro O
has O
many O
applications S-POS
to O
make O
life O
easier O
PUNCT O
unlike O
the O
windows S-NEG
computers O
PUNCT O

and O
the O
screen S-POS
on O
this O
thing O
is O
absolutely O
amazing O
for O
high O
quality O
videos O
and O
movies O
and O
gaming S-POS
PUNCT O

fast O
PUNCT O
fast O
and O
fast O
PUNCT O
the O
web O
pages O
just O
fly O
by O
PUNCT O

i O
considered O
i O
may O
have O
too O
much O
on O
the O
computer O
PUNCT O
but O
after O
looking O
PUNCT O
there O
was O
plenty O
of O
space S-POS
and O
that O
is O
not O
the O
issue O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
use O
my O
laptop O
in O
a O
way O
though O
that O
needs O
a O
long O
battery O
life O
so O
it O
's O
perfect O
for O
me O
PUNCT O

guess O
i O
'll O
stay O
away O
from O
hp O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
made O
better O
PUNCT O
thicker O
PUNCT O
and O
all O
out O
tough O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
about O
six O
months O
later O
when O
the O
overheating O
problem O
started O
again O
PUNCT O
to O
the O
point O
it O
felt O
like O
fire O
on O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
machine O
PUNCT O

there O
is O
a O
blank O
lighted O
screen O
when O
i O
start O
and O
that O
is O
all O
PUNCT O

and O
i O
would O
recommend O
this O
to O
anypne O
looking O
for O
a O
new O
laptop O
PUNCT O

but O
then O
PUNCT O
something O
goes O
wrong O
PUNCT O

so O
far O
so O
good O
with O
this O
laptop O
PUNCT O

i O
must O
keep O
it O
plugged O
in O
at O
all O
times O
because O
it O
will O
not O
keep O
a O
charge S-NEG
for O
longer O
than O
four O
minutes O
PUNCT O

avoid O
this O
model O
PUNCT O

summary O
PUNCT O
i O
've O
had O
this O
laptop O
for O
2 O
months O
PUNCT O
out O
of O
the O
blue O
the O

i O
saw O

for O
about O
PUNCT O
650 O
but O
still O
knowing O
what O
i O
know O
now O
PUNCT O
i O
would O
not O
buy O
it O
at O
that O
price S-NEG

you O

PUNCT O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
new O
one O
PUNCT O

the O
speed S-NEG
difference O
is O
next O
to O
nothing O
for O
a O
mac O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
hard B-NEU

can O
be O
manually O

or O
you O
could O
just O
buy O
a O
PUNCT O
60 O

PUNCT O

2the O
wireless B-NEG

PUNCT O

this O
little O
netboook O
is O
helping O
me O
get O
work O
done O
PUNCT O

they O
also O
use O
two O
totally O
different O
operating B-NEU
systems E-NEU
PUNCT O

they O
are O
about O
the O
same O
size O
keys S-NEU
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
definitely O
not O
hard O
on O
laptops O
and O
guarantee O
100 O
PUNCT O
that O
no O
liquid O
has O
touched O
this O
machine O
in O
my O

PUNCT O

i O
waited O
another O
month O
for O
approval O
and O
for O
them O
to O
build O
me O
a O
new O
laptop O
PUNCT O

this O
ai O
n't O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
n't O
really O
as O
concerned O
about O
portability O
it O
's O
a O
very O
large O
laptop O
but O
it O
's O
not O
hard O
to O
move O
around O
or O
take O
on O
a O
trip O
which O
was O
a O
pleasant O
surprise O
PUNCT O

the O
people O
are O
frustrating O
to O
work O
with O
PUNCT O
the O
product O
itself O
is O
very O
cheaply O
made O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
accessories S-NEG
are O
less O
than O
satisfactory O
PUNCT O

they O
offer O
the O
best O
warranty S-POS
in O
the O
business O
PUNCT O
and O
do O
n't O
3rd O
party O
it O
out O
like O
toshiba O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
problems O
are O
the O
sound S-NEG
isnt O
very O
loud O
i O
have O
to O
wear O
headphones O
PUNCT O

again O
windows S-NEG
based O
machines O
were O
not O
giving O
me O
anything O
to O
work O
with O
PUNCT O

finally O
PUNCT O
i O
could O
n't O
take O
it O
anymore O
and O
ordered O
my O
apple O
PUNCT O

i O
should O
have O
kept O
my O
big O
PUNCT O
old O
hp O
PUNCT O

i O
love O
the O
size S-POS
of O
the O
computer O
since O
i O
play O

on O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
a O
wife O
PUNCT O
mom O
and O
a O
school O
teacher O
and O
a O
college O
student O
PUNCT O

you O
know O
PUNCT O
using O
the O
computer O
should O
be O
fun O
PUNCT O
not O
aggrevation O
PUNCT O
especially O
when O
you O
are O
playing B-NEU
games E-NEU
or O
working O
with O
photos O
PUNCT O

you O
just O
get O
a O
trial O
version O
either O
way O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
all O
for O
saving O
money O
but O
dell O
needs O
to O
step O
it O
up O
PUNCT O

there O
are O
no O
viruses O
or O
spyware O
to O
worry O
about O
like O
on O
a O
windows S-NEG
computer O
PUNCT O

great O
machine O
if O
you O
want O
to O
drop O
the O
cash O
for O
one O
PUNCT O

to O
be O
honest O
i O
think O
it O
was O
faulty O
equipment S-NEG
or O
something O
but O
idk O
PUNCT O

i O
also O
love O
the O
small O
PUNCT O
convenient O
size S-POS
of O
my O
laptop O
PUNCT O
making O
it O
a O
perfect O
tool O
for O
my O
academic O
studies O
PUNCT O

i O
never O
have O
had O
a O
good O
result O
with O
this O
computer O
PUNCT O

i O
love O
its O
solid O
build S-POS
PUNCT O
light O
wt S-POS
and O
excellent O

life E-POS
for O
now O
PUNCT O

you O
pay O
for O
what O
you O
get O
for O
PUNCT O

while O
about O
8 O
years O
ago O
PUNCT O
i O
hope O
that O
the O
quality S-NEG
has O
changed O
PUNCT O

no O
more O
lenovo O
for O
me O
PUNCT O

however O
PUNCT O
a O
netbook O
will O
be O
a O
different O
story O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
glad O
i O
bought O
this O
laptop O
PUNCT O
it O
was O
worth O
the O
few O
PUNCT O
100 O
extra O
dollars O
PUNCT O

the O
difference O
is O
it O
's O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
fun O
using O
the O
laptop O
now O
PUNCT O
still O
learning O
the O
apple B-NEU
navigation E-NEU
PUNCT O
but O
is O
fun O
and O
comes O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
cool O
apps S-POS
PUNCT O

i O
am O
a O
full O
mac O
convert O
now O
PUNCT O

i O
highly O
recommend O
that O
you O
buy O
this O
product O
PUNCT O

though O
you O
get O
a O
polite O
person O
PUNCT O
you O
often O
don O
t O
get O
a O
solution O
PUNCT O

-i O
propose O
that O
i O
can O
just O
swap O
the O
hard B-NEU
drives E-NEU
PUNCT O

it O
was O
old O
but O
it O
was O
not O
till O
we O
bought O
the O
dell O
did O
we O
realize O
how O
great O
it O
was O
PUNCT O

the O
battery S-POS
holds O
up O
well O
PUNCT O
it O
's O
built S-POS
very O
solidly O
PUNCT O
and O
runs S-POS
fast O
PUNCT O

sound B-NEG
card E-NEG
is O
limited O
though O
PUNCT O

i O
initially O
purchased O
my O
macbook O
pro O
13 O
in O
april O
PUNCT O
and O
i O
loved O
it O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
a O
nicely O
sized S-POS
laptop O
with O
lots O
of O
processing B-POS
power E-POS
and O
long O
battery B-POS
life E-POS
PUNCT O

after O
much O
battling O
with O
hp O
i O
was O
able O
to O
return O
it O
4 O
times O
for O
repairs O
PUNCT O

so O
PUNCT O
you O
can O
imagine O
how O
unhappy O
i O
am O
with O
this O
item O
PUNCT O

but O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
PUNCT O
the O
mac O
book O
pro O
is O
so O
professional O
PUNCT O

go O
for O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
highly O
recommend O
this O
computer O
for O
students O
looking O
for O
a O
solid O
machine O
to O
get O
them O
through O
college O
PUNCT O

the O
keyboard O
PUNCT O
which O
generally O
felt O
okay O
even O
for O
someone O
used O
to O
a O
desktop B-NEU
keyboard E-NEU
PUNCT O
now O
looks O
terrible O
PUNCT O

the O
display S-POS
is O
awesome O
PUNCT O

after O
years O
of O
occasionally O
pulling O
my O
hair O
out O
fighting O
computer O
viruses O
PUNCT O
a O
good O
friend O
convinced O
me O
it O
was O
time O
to O
go O
the O
apple O
route O
PUNCT O

however O
PUNCT O
this O
laptop O
has O
a O
fatal O
flaw O
that O
i O
discovered O
merely O
a O
week O
after O
buying O
it O
PUNCT O

perfect O
trifecta O
PUNCT O

the O
keyboard S-NEU
is O
like O
no O
other O
laptop O
keyboard S-NEU
PUNCT O

-computer O
crashed O
frequently O
and O
battery B-NEG
life E-NEG
decreased O
very O
quickly O
PUNCT O

so O
do O
n't O
get O
it O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
a O
tough O
choice O
PUNCT O

every O
driver S-POS
on O
the O
driver S-POS
dvd O
is O
everything O
you O
will O
need O
for O
a O
reload O
PUNCT O

they O
sent O
it O
off O
and O
within O
2 O
weeks O
i O
had O
it O
back O
good O
as O
new O
PUNCT O

the O
awesomest O
of O
the O
awesomest O
PUNCT O

one O
PUNCT O
owning O
a O
mac O
is O
essentially O
a O
full O
production O
studio O
in O
the O
case O
of O
a O
mac O
book O
a O
portable O
version O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
like O
to O
tell O
you O
about O
the O
best O
laptop O
i O
just O
got O
from O
mac O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
glad O
it O
waited O
PUNCT O
this O
one O
is O
great O
PUNCT O

i O
called O
their O
repair B-NEU
depot E-NEU
as O
was O
told O
they O
would O
send O
me O
a O
new O
box O
to O
return O
the O
computer O
to O
the O
repair B-NEU
depot E-NEU
PUNCT O

for O
those O
old O
enough O
to O
remember O
PUNCT O
it O
is O
similar O
to O
beta O
versus O
vhs O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
also O
fairly O
easy O
to O
use O
the O
operating B-POS
system E-POS
PUNCT O

but O
PUNCT O
i O
would O
recommend O
this O
product O
PUNCT O

i O
know O
that O
asus O
is O
known O
for O
making O
motherboards O
PUNCT O
but O
this O
is O
the O
worst O
computer O
experience O
that O
i O
have O
ever O
had O
PUNCT O

if O
so O
PUNCT O
you O
may O
be O
having O
similar O
problems O
PUNCT O

some O
days O
it O
's O
just O
blurry O
PUNCT O
some O

it O
appears O
that O
it O
's O
raining O
on O
my O
nice O

background O
of O
a O

PUNCT O

this O
is O
a O
great O
machine O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
my O
first O
personal O
satellite O
purchase O
but O
had O
very O
good O
experience O
through O
previous O
satellite O
work O
issued O
laptops O
PUNCT O

we O
figure O
that O
after O
everything O
his O
pc O
actually O
ended O
up O
costing S-NEG
PUNCT O
350 O
more O
than O
my O
original O

peformance S-POS
is O

consider O
myself O
an O

this O

adjust O

after O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
PUNCT O
my O

life O
began O
to O
diminish O

was O
replaced O
for O

due O
to O
a O
company-wide O
recall O
of O
my O
particular O
battery S-NEG
PUNCT O

the O
system S-NEG
constantly O
overheats O
PUNCT O
the O
battery B-NEG
life E-NEG
is O
too O
short O
PUNCT O
the O
case S-NEG
is O
coming O
apart O

my O

that O
i O
use O
every O

later O
it O
held O
zero O

its O
replacement O
worked O
for O
less O
than O
three O
months O
PUNCT O

the O
company O
sent O
me O
a O
whole O
new O
cord S-POS
overnight O
and O
apologized O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
even O
easy O
to O
hook B-POS
up I-POS
to I-POS
other I-POS
wireless I-POS
networks E-POS
PUNCT O

also O
PUNCT O
i O
have O

alot O

with O
the O

PUNCT O

the O

did O
not O
even O
answer O
my O

to O
ask O
him O
PUNCT O
if O
he O
understood O
what O

because O
he O
did O
n't O
even O
try O

my O
question O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
now O
frustrated O
that O
i O
still O
have O

use O
my O
work O

PUNCT O

it O
gives O
me O
the O
power S-POS
and O

that O
i O
need O

run O
all O
the O
programs S-NEU
i O
use O
to O
edit O
PUNCT O

ilife S-POS
is O
easily O
compatible O
with O
microsoft B-NEU
office E-NEU
so O
you O
can O
send O
and O
receive O
files O
from O
a O
pc O
PUNCT O

they O
do O
n't O
crash O
PUNCT O

as O
a O
computer O
science O
student O
in O
college O
PUNCT O
i O
find O
that O
the O
portability S-POS
PUNCT O
longevity S-POS
PUNCT O
and O
ease O
of O
use S-POS
of O
this O
computer O
make O
me O
shockingly O
want O
to O
do O
homework O
more O
PUNCT O

this O
notebook O
restarts O
every O
time O
there O
is O
a O
new O
update O
PUNCT O
so O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
save O
your O

information O
PUNCT O
everything O
will O
be O
lost O
PUNCT O

i O
love O
this O
little O
one O
PUNCT O

so O
not O
having O

was O
discouraging O
PUNCT O

i O
fine O

notebook O
meets O
all O
my O
needs O
for O
a O

computer O
when O
on O
the O
go O
PUNCT O

again O
i O
sent O
it O
back O
and O
they O
replaced O
the O
motherboard S-NEU
and O
some O
fan S-NEU
inside O
PUNCT O

fully O
charged S-POS
PUNCT O
the O
macbook O
pro O
can O
last O
about O
five O
hours O
unplugged O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
a O
hard O
decision O
for O
me O
since O
the O
macbook O
pro O
looked O
so O
appealing O
PUNCT O

1st O
hand O
experience O
is O
very O
important O
PUNCT O
especially O
for O
a O
new O
customer O
PUNCT O

i O
especially O
appreciate O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
has O
almost O
zero O
viruses O
and O
spyware O
problems O
PUNCT O

even O
though O
it O
is O
much O
more O
expensive O
than O
many O
pc O
laptops O
PUNCT O
it O
is O
worth O
the O
price O
PUNCT O

i O
know O
there O
are O
way O
better O
laptops O
out O
there O
for O
the O
same O
price S-NEU
PUNCT O
and O
why O
spend O
money O
on O
shit O
when O
you O
can O
go O
out O
and O
get O
yourself O
a O
perfectly O
decent O
laptop O
that O
doesnt O
suck O
total O
monkey O
balls O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
like O
this O
company O
nor O
the O
toshiba O
brand O
PUNCT O
and O
i O
'll O
never O
buy O
another O
one O
because O
i O
've O
put O
more O
into O
it O
then O
it O
is O
worth O
PUNCT O

ca O
n't O
reinstall O
with O
standard B-NEG
os I-NEG
cd E-NEG
because O
of O
proprietary B-NEG
hardware I-NEG
drivers E-NEG
PUNCT O

however O
PUNCT O
this O
will O
be O
my O
last O
as O
well O
PUNCT O

there O
is O
a O
small O
red O
circle O
next O
to O
it O
with O
a O
x O
in O
the O
middle O
PUNCT O
and O
when O
i O
click O
on O
it O
it O
says O
PUNCT O
consider O
replacing O
your O
battery S-NEU
and O
it O
does O
not O
hold O
full O

PUNCT O

so O
PUNCT O
how O
can O
you O
solve O
it O
PUNCT O
c'mon O
PUNCT O
i O
just O
bought O
the O
netbook O
2 O
weeks O
ago O
PUNCT O

the O
computer O
was O
two O
weeks O
late O
in O
delivery S-NEG
because O

complete O
the O

import O

PUNCT O

if O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
a O
great O

PUNCT O
you O
've O
found O
the O
best O
here O
PUNCT O

the O
first O
programm S-NEU
i O
switched O
on O
was O
a O
game O
for O
my O

PUNCT O

i O
have O
been O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
performance S-POS
of O
this O
laptop O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
had O
my O
macbook O
for O
almost O
6 O
months O
and O
can O
honestly O
say O
that O
i O
will O
never O
buy O
another O
computer O
if O
it O
is O
not O
a O
mac O
PUNCT O

i O
've O
always O
owned O
a O
pc O
and O
decided O
to O
try O
a O
macbook O
to O
see O
what O
it O
's O
all O
about O
PUNCT O

on O
two O
occasions O
the O
computer O
s O
calendar O
told O
me O
it O
was O
1969 O
PUNCT O

i O
bought O
it O
for O
my O
mom O
and O
she O
reports O
that O
the O
battery B-POS
life E-POS
lasts O
all O
day O
for O
her O
PUNCT O
it O
's O
very O
lightweight O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
response S-POS
for O
the O
computing O
she O
's O
doing O
internet B-NEU
focused I-NEU
activity E-NEU
PUNCT O
mail O
PUNCT O
research O
PUNCT O
etc O
is O
excellent O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

its O
very O
nice O
and O
once O
you O
learn O
the O
features S-NEU
you O
will O
be O
so O
happy O
to O
have O
such O
a O
sophisticated O
computer O
PUNCT O

overall O
PUNCT O
this O
is O
a O
wonderful O
computer O
and O
definitly O
worth O
the O
purchase O
PUNCT O

it O
came O
alot O
faster O
than O
i O
thought O
it O
would O
have O
which O
was O
really O
exciting O
PUNCT O

then O
to O
make O
matters O
worst O
PUNCT O
there O
is O
noone O
that O
they O
can O
transfer O
you O
to O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
sleek O
and O
lightweight O
and O
charges S-POS
quickly O
when O
needed O
PUNCT O

also O
you O
may O
need O
to O
charge S-NEU
it O
once O
a O
day O
PUNCT O
if O
for O
medium O
use O
every O
thing O
fast O
and O
easy O
with O
mac O
the O
size S-POS
and O
look S-POS
is O
the O
most O
feature S-POS
that O
attracted O
me O
to O
it O
PUNCT O

but O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
computer O
field O
you O
probably O
would O
n't O
be O
here O
PUNCT O

the O
great O
18 O
month O
same O
as O
cash O
financing O
and O
advance O

includes O

PUNCT O

i O
could O
not O

can O
the O

i O
purchased O
PUNCT O

the O
new O

nothing O

PUNCT O

i O

PUNCT O
i O
love O
this O

so O
much O
and O
i O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone O
PUNCT O

they O
respond O
PUNCT O
your O
dissatisfaction O
is O
noted O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
even O
able O

PUNCT O

the O

PUNCT O

i O
did O
think O
it O
had O
a O

that O
was O
one O
of O
my O
requirements O
PUNCT O
but O
forgot O
to O
check O
in O
the O
specifications S-NEU
on O
this O
one O
before O
i O
purchased O
PUNCT O

also O
the O
display S-POS
is O
exceptional O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
basically O
the O
best O

i O
have O
ever O

PUNCT O

i O
tell O
everyone O

honestly O
PUNCT O
i O
was O
n't O
expecting O
anything O
less O

perfection O
PUNCT O
and O
i O
was O
n't O
disappointed O
PUNCT O

learning O
all O
of O
the O

only O
took O
a O

of O
the O

the O

on O

you O
get O
what O

it O
did O

come O
with O
any O
software S-NEG

PUNCT O

for O
the O

PUNCT O
i O
was O

the O

this O

PUNCT O

most O
of O
the O

i O
took O

30 O
min O
PUNCT O
it O

freezing O
up O

did O
the O

PUNCT O

i O
think O
this O
computer O
is O
super O
lame O
PUNCT O

it O
had O
a O
seventeen O
inch O
screen O
which O
i O
wanted O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
did O
n't O
realize O
at O
the O
time O
it O
would O
be O
such O
a O
monster O
PUNCT O

even O
doing O

PUNCT O
the O

PUNCT O

i O
would O
tell O
the O

i O
knew O
exactly O
what O
was O
wrong O
with O
it O
but O
they O
did O
not O
listen O
and O
i O
had O
to O
go O
through O
a O
bunch O
of O
junk O
to O
get O
them O
to O
tell O
me O
i O
needed O
to O
send O
the O

i O
purchased O
two O

16 O

summary O
PUNCT O
spend O

believe O
me O
apple O

a O
reputation O
PUNCT O

the O
ilife B-POS
software E-POS
that O

produces O

the O

PUNCT O

the O
apple O

are O
over O

that O
ar O
n't O
worth O
what O
they O
are O
being O
charged O
for O
PUNCT O
this O
model O
's O
specifications S-NEG
are O
far O
from O
being O
impressive O
and O
they O
only O
thing O
you O
get O
out O
of O
this O
is O
the O
apple O
name O
PUNCT O

my O
mac O
laptop O
is O
fabulous O
in O
both O
areas O
PUNCT O

pros O
PUNCT O
the O
macbook O
pro O
notebook O
has O
a O
large O
battery B-POS
life E-POS
and O
you O
wont O
have O
to O
worry O
to O
charge O
your O
laptop O
every O
five O
hours O
or O
so O
PUNCT O

i O
highly O
recommend O
this O
product O
PUNCT O

disappointing O
for O
such O
a O
lovely O
screen S-POS
and O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price S-POS

so O
far O
PUNCT O
it O
's O
an O
average O
laptop O
PUNCT O
no O
better O
PUNCT O
no O
worse O
than O
the O
hp O
i O
replaced O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
bad O
thing O
about O
it O
is O
they O
give O
you O
the O
worst O
batteries S-NEG
possible O
PUNCT O

good O
price S-POS
PUNCT O

the O
motherboard S-NEG
is O
dead O
PUNCT O

the O
speed S-POS
is O
fine O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
starting O
to O
boil O
PUNCT O

hmmm O
PUNCT O
that O
high O
failure O
rate O
sure O
is O
n't O
reflected O
in O
the O
retail B-NEG
price E-NEG
PUNCT O

back O
she O
goes O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
not O
clear O
that O
the O
microsoft B-NEG
student I-NEG
edition E-NEG
that O
was O
loaded O
on O
the O
computer O
PUNCT O
was O
a O
six O
month O
trial O
PUNCT O

not O
the O
day O
received O
PUNCT O

good O
for O
every B-POS
day I-POS
computing E-POS
and O
web B-POS
browsing E-POS
PUNCT O

while O
lacking O
some O
of O
the O
functions O
of O
the O
other O
versions O
PUNCT O
this O
was O
very O
acceptable O
for O
the O
uses O
planned O
for O
this O
computer O
PUNCT O

also O
PUNCT O
i O
have O
had O
alot O
of O
trouble O
with O
the O
keys S-NEG
sticking O
and O
will O
not O
type O
correctly O
PUNCT O

it O
still O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
little O
lose O
now O
but O
so O
far O
seems O
to O
be O
hanging O
in O
there O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
by O
far O
one O
of O
the O
greatest O
investments O
i O
have O
ever O
made O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
are O
a O
pc O
user O
looking O
to O
convert O
i O
would O
highly O
recommend O
it O
PUNCT O

excellent O
led B-POS
monitor E-POS
and O
well O
equipped O
PUNCT O

this O
process O
continued O
to O
repeat O
itself O
until O
the O
mother B-NEG
board E-NEG
had O
been O
replaced O
4 O
times O
and O
the O
hard B-NEG
drive E-NEG
replaced O
3 O
times O
PUNCT O

without O
a O
doubt O
PUNCT O
the O
*aspect0* O
of O
this O
laptop O
is O
fantastic O
PUNCT O

i O
could O
n't O
believe O
how O
long O
the O
battery S-POS
lasted O
on O
a O
single O
charge S-POS
PUNCT O

i O
could O
save O
ten O
essay O
papers O
and O
have O
hardly O
any O
memory S-NEG
left O
PUNCT O

took O
a O
while O
to O
clean O
it O
up O
to O
my O
specs O
PUNCT O

they O
are O
so O
realistic O
i O
am O
just O
speechless O
PUNCT O

other O
than O
that O
PUNCT O
i O
would O
recommend O
this O
to O
someone O
in O
need O
of O
a O
cheap O
laptop O
with O
semi-decent O
gaming S-POS
capabilities O
PUNCT O

but O
the O
biggest O
pain O
is O
that O
tech B-NEG
support E-NEG
is O
not O
available O
24/7 O
PUNCT O

there O
are O
differences O
that O
you O
need O
to O
know O
and O
take O
time O
to O
learn O
PUNCT O

they O
have O
more O
problems O
then O
a O
1980 O
's O
computer O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
amazing O
PUNCT O

needless O
to O
say O
PUNCT O
not O
to O
happy O
with O
the O
product O
PUNCT O

the O
cool O
thing O
about O
this O
is O
anyone O
can O
use O
it O
PUNCT O

my O
first O
laptop O
was O
an O
acer O
that O
i O
got O
for O
christmas O
PUNCT O

still O
PUNCT O
this O
laptop O
is O
perfect O
for O
all O
day O
use O
at O
school O
and O
work O
PUNCT O

the O
internet O
can O
be O
an O
scary O
place O
its O
up O
to O
you O
on O
what O
you O
do O
with O
it O
PUNCT O

the O
backlit B-POS
keys E-POS
are O
wonderful O
when O
you O
are O
working O
in O
the O
dark O
PUNCT O

i O
chose O
the O
ibookg4 O
PUNCT O
a O
laptop O
that O
is O
an O
attractive O
computer O
with O
a O
large O
screen S-POS
big O
enough O
to O
please O
anyone O
PUNCT O

the O
most O
recent O
being O
that O
my O
safari B-NEG
internet I-NEG
browser E-NEG
is O
freaking O
out O
on O
me O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
have O
just O
been O
using O
firefox S-POS
instead O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
say O
if O
you O
want O
to O
buy O
one O
of O
these O
machines O
be O
careful O
PUNCT O

i O
know O
what O
7 O
hrs O
of O
battery S-POS
looks O
like O
PUNCT O

the O
macbooks O
worth O
every O
penny O
PUNCT O

i O
did O
not O
have O
to O
call O
the O
support B-NEU
line E-NEU
at O
all O
PUNCT O

the O
laptop O
is O
outstanding O
in O
all O
aspects O
except O
that O
it O
has O
the O
windows B-NEG
7 I-NEG
starter E-NEG
and O
not O
the O
full O
windows B-POS
7 E-POS
PUNCT O

the O
first O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
keyboard B-NEG
function E-NEG
is O
simply O
unsatisfactory O
PUNCT O

the O
dvd B-NEG
drive E-NEG
randomly O
pops O
open O
when O
it O
is O
in O
my O
backpack O
as O
well O
PUNCT O
which O
is O
annoying O
PUNCT O

garageband S-NEU
is O
more O
for O
the O
musicians O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
laptop O
is O
equipped O
with O
a O
good O
working O
microphone S-POS
PUNCT O
good O
enough O
for O
beginners O
and O
musicians O
at O
the O
intermediate O
level O
PUNCT O

i O
dual O
boot O
with O
linux S-NEU
and O
that O
other O
security-prone B-NEU
os E-NEU
and O
it O
performs S-POS
flawlessly O
PUNCT O

the O
difference O
is O
the O
toshiba O
had O
a O
lot O
more O
memory S-POS
and O
hard B-POS
drive I-POS
space E-POS
PUNCT O

there O
was O
a O
little O
difficulty O
doing O
the O
migration O
as O
the O
firewire B-NEG
cable I-NEG
system E-NEG
ca O
n't O
be O
used O
with O
the O

PUNCT O

do O
n't O
waste O
your O
money O
PUNCT O

-managed O
to O
send O

however O
PUNCT O
they O
were O
kind O
enough O
to O

PUNCT O

seriously O
considering O
a O
larger O
laptop O
to O
replace O
the O
dell O

os B-POS
x E-POS
is O
solid O
with O
lots O
of O
innovations O
such O
as O
quicklook S-POS
which O
save O
heaps O
of O

PUNCT O

i O
do O
everything O

and O
we O
even O
watch O
all O

our O

on O
it O
since O
we O
do O
not O
have O
a O

PUNCT O

i O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
a O
simple O
job O
PUNCT O

but O
other O
than O
that O
i O
am O
blown O
away O
by O
all O
the O
features S-POS
this O
laptop O
offers O
PUNCT O

i O
hate O
it O
PUNCT O

do O
n't O
buy O
this O
model O
PUNCT O

the O
keyboard S-POS
is O
slick O
and O
quiet O
and O
not O
bulky O
like O
some O
other O
laptops O
i O
have O
had O
in O
the O
past O
PUNCT O

overall O
PUNCT O
this O
laptop O
is O
definitely O
a O
keeper O
with O
its O
simple O

stylish O
design S-POS
and O
its O
array O
of O
fantastic O
colors S-POS
to O

i O
love O

PUNCT O

the O
last O
time O
we O
took O
it O
to O
get O

the O

said O
that O
most O
likely O
it O
is O
a O
reppative O
problem O

will O
keep O
happeneing O
so O
hopefully O
we O
can O
get O
a O
new O
one O
very O
soon O

3-4 O

how O
to O

a O

fairly O
quickly O
PUNCT O

with O
the O
upgraded B-POS
memory E-POS
PUNCT O
the O
macbook O

never O
has O
an O
issue O
running S-POS
many O
many O
applications S-NEU
at O
once O
PUNCT O

simple O
to O
use S-POS
PUNCT O
and O
great O
graphics S-POS
PUNCT O

it O
still O
serves O
me O
well O
both O
in O
business O

home O
needs O
PUNCT O

i O
use O
my O
friends O
and O
family O

PUNCT O
2000 O
laptops O
and O
they O
are O
fast O
and O
reliable O
and O
hp O
PUNCT O
well O
PUNCT O
i O
'll O
never O
buy O
or O
recommend O
an O

to O
anyone O
PUNCT O

my O
macbook O
is O
probably O
the O
best O
investment O
i O
have O
ever O
made O
PUNCT O

the O
internet B-POS
speed E-POS
is O
spectacular O
PUNCT O

they O
claim O
call B-NEG
center E-NEG
is O
still O
down O
PUNCT O

mac O
also O
has O
many O
apps S-POS
and O
programs S-POS
that O
are O
quite O
cheap O
or O
free O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
shop O
around O
in O
the O
current O

you O
can O
find O
a O
much O
better O
deal O
PUNCT O

you O
will O
love O
this O
macbook O
if O
you O
choose O
to O
buy O
it O
PUNCT O

my O
house O

PUNCT O

they O
're O
not O

PUNCT O
they O
're O
not O

PUNCT O
they O
just O
a O
worthless O
PUNCT O

my O
husband O
uses O
it O
mostly O
for O
games S-NEU
PUNCT O
email O
and O
music O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
had O
no O
luck O
with O
staples O
or O
hp O
to O
resolve O
this O
problem O
PUNCT O

i O
just O
took O
the O
broken O
cords S-POS
into O
the O
apple O
store O
and O
they O
gave O
me O
new O
ones O
PUNCT O

my O
mac O
is O
much O
more O
efficient O
than O
a O
pc O
so O
it O
does O
not O
need O
the O
extra O
bells O
and O
whistles O
to O
compete O
PUNCT O

it O
works O
PUNCT O

you O
just O
lose O
a O
customer O
PUNCT O

i O
ve O
had O
several O
calls O
lasting O
more O
than O
an O
hour O
with O
promises O
to O
call O
back O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
return O
calls O
never O
came O
PUNCT O

apparently O
under O
the O
screen S-NEU
there O
are O
2 O
little O
screws O
and O
when O
the O
screen S-NEU
gets O
moved O
back O
and O
forth O
PUNCT O
they O
come O
loose O
PUNCT O

being O
a O
pc O
user O
my O
whole O
life O
PUNCT O
it O
's O
taking O
a O
bit O
of O
time O
to O
adapt O
to O
the O
os S-NEU
of O
a O
mac O
but O
i O
'm O
finding O
my O
way O
around O
PUNCT O

the O
computer O
will O
constantly O
be O
getting O
hot O
and O
burning O
your O
leg O
unless O
you O
go O
through O
the O
hassle O
of O
taking O
off O
the O
entire O
back O
of O
it O
just O
to O
clean O
out O
the O
fan S-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
have O
in O
the O
past O
gotten O
superfine O
sandpaper O
and O
fixed O
the O
edges S-NEG
by O
rounding O
them O
off O
PUNCT O

i O
hate O
it O
PUNCT O

downfalls O
PUNCT O
sharp O
edges S-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
needed O
one O
to O
be O
able O
to O
carry S-NEU
to O
work O
everyday O
and O
this O
one O
seems O
to O
fit O
all O
of O
the O
criteria O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
recommend O
mac O
PUNCT O
and O
do O
PUNCT O
to O
anyone O
looking O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
computer O
PUNCT O

the O
screen S-POS
is O
gorgeous O
PUNCT O
yummy O
good O
PUNCT O

did O
i O
mention O
everything O
about O
it O
PUNCT O
from O
size S-NEG
to O

to O
keyboard S-NEG
screams O

PUNCT O

ca O
n't O
wait O
until O

take O
it O
with O
me O
PUNCT O

good O
bye O
blue O
screen O
and O
critical O
errors O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

i O
had O
it O
four O
months O
when O
my O
disc B-NEG
drive E-NEG
refused O
to O
open O
PUNCT O

so O
PUNCT O
after O
apple O
replaced O
the O
hard B-NEU
drive E-NEU
i O
enjoyed O
another O
4 O
months O
of O
my O
new O
computer O
PUNCT O
until O
it O
froze O
this O
morning O
-- O
completely O
PUNCT O

once O
again O
PUNCT O
i O
was O
told O
it O
was O
the O
suspicious O

problem O
PUNCT O

the O
macbook O
starts S-POS
fast O
PUNCT O
does O
n't O
crash O
PUNCT O
has O
a O
fantastic O
display S-POS
PUNCT O
is O
small O
and O
light O
i O
have O
the O

PUNCT O
and O
is O

always O
complaining O
about O

PUNCT O
lost O
connections O
PUNCT O
errors O
PUNCT O
blue O
screens O
PUNCT O
etc O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
kind O
of O
a O
rebellion O
against O
pc O
in O
fact O
PUNCT O
and O
i O
am O
certainly O
glad O
i O
did O
PUNCT O

unable O
to O
boot B-NEG
up E-NEG
this O
brand O
new O
laptop O
PUNCT O

in O
addition O
PUNCT O
all O
the O
design O
tools O
on O
pages S-POS
and O
keynotes S-POS
makes O
it O
much O
easier O
to O
create O
professional O
looking O
documents O
and O
presentations O
PUNCT O

i O
really O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
am O
stuck O
PUNCT O

the O
port S-NEU
is O
secured O
to O
motherboard S-NEU
so O
when O
this O
happens O
you O
ca O
n't O
see O
the O
plug S-NEG
at O
all O
PUNCT O
it O
's O
just O
gone O
PUNCT O

-stay O
away O
from O
machouse O
amsterdam O
PUNCT O

once O
again O
apple O
stands O
alone O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O

PUNCT O

i O
love O
the O
feel O
of O
the O
key B-POS
board E-POS
PUNCT O
as O
well O
as O
the O
trackpad S-POS
PUNCT O

now O
i O
have O
the O
best O
of O
both O
worlds O
with O
all O
of O
the O
power S-POS
and O
ease S-POS
of O
the O
mac O
PUNCT O

these O
new O
problems O
were O
the O
final O
straws O
PUNCT O

luckly O
i O
had O
a O
student O
task O
force O
able O
to O
help O
PUNCT O
or O
else O
it O
would O
have O
crashed O
within O
the O
first O
year O
PUNCT O

that O
seemed O
to O
solve O
the O
problem O
PUNCT O
till O
i O
wrote O
an O
article O
with O
semicolons O
in O
it O
PUNCT O

ease O
of O
use S-POS
is O
just O
one O
of O
the O
benefits O
i O
love O
about O
my O
mac O
PUNCT O

-aspect0 O
will O
take O
a O
bit O
of O
time O
to O
get O
used O
to O
PUNCT O

we O
both O
recently O
got O
new O
laptops O
PUNCT O

i O
got O
the O
macbook O
and O
he O
got O
a O
macbook O
pro O
PUNCT O

winters O
is O
on O
it O
's O
way O
and O
i O
imagine O
it O
will O
be O
cozy O
PUNCT O

i O
bought O
this O
laptop O
about O
a O
month O
ago O
to O
replace O
my O
compaq O
laptop O
PUNCT O

now O
the O
machine O
wo O
n't O
connect O
and O
toshiba O
says O
that O
they O
did O
replace O
the O
connection B-NEU
card E-NEU
in O
may O
but O
they O
only O
warranty S-NEG
the O
repair O
for O
30 O
days O
and O
now O
i O
'm O
out O
of O
warranty S-NEG
even O
though O
this O
has O
been O
a O
constant O
5 O
month O
occurance O
since O
i O
bought O
the O
netbook O
PUNCT O

but O
PUNCT O
buy O
this O
model O
and O
just O
purchase O
4gb B-NEU
of I-NEU
ram E-NEU
2x2gb O
for O
PUNCT O
92 O
or O
1x4gb O
for O
PUNCT O
99 O
PUNCT O
and O
save O
yourself O
PUNCT O
100 O
than O
the O
other O
model O
with O
8gb B-NEU
of I-NEU
ram E-NEU
PUNCT O

this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
i O
purchased O
it O
PUNCT O

instead O
of O
taking O
another O
chance O
on O
toshiba O
PUNCT O
i O
went O
with O
an O
asus O
g73jh-x3 O
PUNCT O

she O
told O
me O
flatly O
PUNCT O
it O
's O
like O
that O
one O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
something O
to O
fly O
through O
those O
massive O
spreadsheets O
or O
play O
a O
graphics-intensive O
game S-NEU
PUNCT O
you O
'd O
be O
better O
off O
getting O
a O
machine O
aimed O
at O
that O
segment O
of O
the O
market O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
the O
easiest O
computer O
i O
have O
ever O
used O

browsing S-POS
PUNCT O
also O
PUNCT O
was O
no O
problem O
for O
me O
when O
i O
used O
itunes S-POS
which O
usually O
slows O
down O
my O
pc O
PUNCT O

should O
be O
there O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
week O
again O
PUNCT O

again O
PUNCT O
decent O
comp O
for O
the O
price S-POS
PUNCT O
and O
i O
was O
in O
need O
of O
one O
quickly O
as O
my O
other O
laptop O
died O
on O
me O
PUNCT O

so O
in O
a O
brief O
summary O
i O
would O
have O
to O
say O
that O
i O
would O
not O
recommend O
dell O
vostro O
1000 O
to O
anyone O
due O
to O
it O
being O
a O
down O
right O
awful O
setup S-NEG
so O
in O
my O
opinion O
you O
should O
steer O
clear O
of O
them O
if O
you O
want O
a O
decent O
laptop O
PUNCT O

i O
just O
got O
this O
laptop O
for O
college O
PUNCT O
and O
so O
far O
i O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
PUNCT O

tosiba O
has O
a O
good O
reputation O
PUNCT O
my O
llast O
computer O
was O
an O
acer O
PUNCT O

my O
friend O
just O
had O
to O
replace O
his O
entire O
motherboard S-NEG
PUNCT O
so O
did O
my O
wife O
PUNCT O
and O
it O
looks O
like O
i O
will O
have O
to O
as O
well O
PUNCT O

toshiba B-NEG
customer I-NEG
services E-NEG
will O
indirectly O
deal O
with O
your O
problems O
by O
constantly O
tranferring O
you O
from O
one O
country O
to O
another O
PUNCT O
and O
i O
am O
not O
kidding O
you O
PUNCT O
i O
called O
different O
hours O
of O
the O
day O
and O
you O
'll O
get O
someone O
else O
from O
another O
country O
trying O
to O
get O
you O
to O
tell O
them O
your O
life O
story O
all O
over O
again O
PUNCT O
since O
they O
make O
it O
sound O
like O
they O
do O
n't O
have O
your O
history O
list O
of O
your O
calls O
right O
in O
front O
of O
them O
PUNCT O

quality B-POS
display E-POS
i O
was O
surprised O
with O
the O
performance S-POS
and O
quality S-POS
of O
this O
hp O
laptop O
PUNCT O

the O
battery B-NEG
life E-NEG
also O
does O
n't O
keep O
up O
with O
the O
claim O
but O
still O
i O
think O
macbook O
is O
much O
ahead O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
pack O
PUNCT O

the O
internet B-POS
capabilities E-POS
are O
also O
very O
strong O
and O
picks O
up O
signals O
very O
easily O
PUNCT O

its O
fast O
PUNCT O
has O
high B-POS
definition I-POS
quality E-POS
in O
the O
videos O
PUNCT O

they O
transfer O
you O
around O
to O
other O
people O
who O
do O
not O
understand O
what O
you O
are O
saying O
and O
you O
ca O
n't O
understand O
what O
they O
are O
saying O
PUNCT O

speakers O
do O
n't O
get O
that O
loud O
PUNCT O
but O
good O
enough O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
had O
it O
9 O
months O
and O
it O
is O
already O
a O
PUNCT O
250 O
loss O
PUNCT O

another O
great O
thing O
is O
the O
beast B-POS
graphics E-POS
PUNCT O

i O
was O
wrong O
PUNCT O

everything O
i O
have O
tried O
has O
worked O
and O
i O
never O
have O
to O
carry O
the O
wall B-NEU
charger E-NEU
cause O
the O
battery S-POS
is O
so O
awesome O
PUNCT O

screen O
is O
crystal O
clear O
PUNCT O
yes O
it O
's O
small O
PUNCT O
but O
it O
's O
a O
netbook O
PUNCT O

so O
this O
review O
might O
be O
a O
tad O
bit O
bias O
PUNCT O

the O
battery B-NEG
life E-NEG
is O
probably O
an O
hour O
at O
best O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
a O
review O
of O
windows B-NEU
vista I-NEU
system E-NEU
PUNCT O

she O
said O
its O
very O
user O
friendly O
PUNCT O

kind O
of O
annoying O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
still O
love O
the O
laptop O
PUNCT O

cosmetically O
PUNCT O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
changed O
was O
2 O
of O
the O
function B-NEU
keys E-NEU
at O
the O
top O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
very O
happy O
i O
bought O
this O
mac O
PUNCT O
well O
worth O
the O
extra O
money O
PUNCT O

but O
sadly O
the O
replacement O
froze-up O
while O
updating O
the O
bios S-NEG
again O
and O
shut O
down O
and O
would O
not O
turn O
back O
on O
PUNCT O

there O
's O
literally O
no O
way O
to O
make O
it O
sing O
with O
vista S-NEG
PUNCT O

after O
looking O
at O
all O
the O
pros O
and O
cons O
PUNCT O
i O
decided O
on O
the O
macbook O
pro O
PUNCT O

screen B-POS
size E-POS
is O
perfect O
for O
portable O
use O
in O
any O
environment O
PUNCT O

first O
PUNCT O
it O
does O
not O
have O
a O
push B-NEG
button E-NEG
to O
open O
the O
lid S-NEU
PUNCT O

hope O
this O
helped O
PUNCT O

i O
used O
to O
build O
my O
own O
desktops O
from O
the O
component O
parts O
PUNCT O
and O
recently O
my O
7 O
year O
old O
pentium B-NEU
4 E-NEU
with O
ht O
1 B-NEU
gb I-NEU
ram E-NEU
sata O
desktop O
stopped O
working O
this O
was O
a O
rock O
star O
7 O
years O
ago O
PUNCT O

i O
now O
realize O
that O
my O
PUNCT O
900 O
would O
have O
been O
better O
spent O
on O
a O
windows S-POS
laptop O
PUNCT O

this O
laptop O
serves O
all O
my O
needs O
PUNCT O

and O
printing O
from O
either O
word B-NEG
processor E-NEG
is O
an O
adventure O
PUNCT O

very O
satisfied O
PUNCT O

do O
not O
buy O
it O
PUNCT O

-estimated O
time O
to O
fix O
it O
PUNCT O
10 O
working O
days O
or O
less O
PUNCT O

after O
purchasing O
this O
thing O
PUNCT O
i O
find O
out O
that O
i O
need O
a O
special O
interface B-NEG
device E-NEG
to O
connect O
my O
camera O
PUNCT O
and O
that O
it O
can O
not O
be O
purchased O
at O
the O
store O
PUNCT O
only O
on O
line O
PUNCT O

another O
included B-NEG
program E-NEG
that O
is O
laughable O
is O
the O
chess O
game O
PUNCT O

yes O
PUNCT O
i O
thought O
the O
expese S-NEG
was O
a O
little O
much O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
now O
realize O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
PUNCT O

it O
works O
great O
for O
general O
internet B-POS
use E-POS
PUNCT O
microsoft B-POS
office I-POS
apps E-POS
PUNCT O
home O
bookkeeping O
PUNCT O
etc O
PUNCT O

i O
will O
not O
buy O
another O
one O
PUNCT O

time O
will O
tell O
PUNCT O

the O
price S-POS
was O
very O
good O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
product O
is O
top O
quality S-POS
PUNCT O

it O
played O
various O
games S-NEU
without O
problems O
and O
ran O
aero S-NEU
smoothly O
and O
flawlessly O
PUNCT O

after O
replacing O
the O
hard B-NEU
drive E-NEU
the O
battery S-NEG
stopped O
working O
3 O
months O
of O
use O
which O
was O
frustrating O
PUNCT O

the O
screen S-NEG
almost O
looked O
like O
a O
barcode O
when O
it O
froze O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
found O
a O
lot O
of O
online O
sources O
to O
help O
me O
but O
think O
that O
i O
would O
have O
learned O
a O
lot O
quicker O
if O
i O
would O
have O
taken O
the O
class O
PUNCT O

she O
tells O
me O
about O
it O
all O
the O
time O
but O
i O
tend O
to O
shut O
off O
all O
cognitive O
functions O
when O
she O
gets O
that O
yapper O
going O
PUNCT O

i O
could O
not O
even O
put O
my O
entire O
music O
collection O
on O
this O
garabage O
PUNCT O

its O
small O
enough O
where O
i O
can O
take O
it O
pretty O
much O
anywhere O
PUNCT O
but O
still O
has O
a O
big O
enough O
screen S-POS
to O
get O
everything O
done O
PUNCT O

it O
even O
has O
a O
great O
webcam S-POS
PUNCT O
and O
skype S-POS
works O
very O
well O
PUNCT O

i O
love O
the O
solid O
machined B-POS

PUNCT O

the O

some O
getting O

because O
it O

i O
regret O

understanding O
how O
awful O
it O
is O
to O

PUNCT O

the O

PUNCT O

dealing O

that O
after O

the O

well O
PUNCT O

the O
toshiba O

a O

purchase O
PUNCT O

after O

great O
PUNCT O

i O

but O
i O
ca O
n't O
give O

that O
PUNCT O
unless O
y'all O
get O
serious O
about O

making O

less O
obtrusive O
i O
will O
be O
looking O
to O
different O

next O

PUNCT O

now O
that O
i O
have O
it O
i O
see O
that O
i O
really O
needed O
this O
for O
much O
more O
PUNCT O

after O
numerous O
calls O
to O
applecare B-NEG
tech I-NEG
support E-NEG
PUNCT O
i O
was O
directed O
to O
send O
in O
my O

PUNCT O

the O
abuse O
is O
that O
i O
pushed O
the O
power B-NEG
plug E-NEG
in O
too O
hard O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
easy O
to O
find O
documents O
PUNCT O
and O
keep O
them O
in O
one O

PUNCT O

the O
resolution B-POS
on I-POS
the I-POS

is O
almost O
pure O

PUNCT O

not O
sure O
how O
i O
recommend O
it O
for O
quality O
gaming S-NEG
PUNCT O
as O
i O
have O
a O

that O
reason O
PUNCT O

as O
a O

PUNCT O
i O
will O
will O
admit O
that O
the O

has O
a O
better O
running B-POS

in O
which O
i O
found O
myself O
getting O

the O

not O
ever O
cut O

the O

such O
that O

PUNCT O

i O
would O
have O
to O
say O
that O
overall O
its O
great O
PUNCT O

and O
they O
replaced O
the O
awesome O
ergonomic O
small O

with O
a O
power B-POS
supply E-POS
that O
weighed O
more O
than O
the O

itself O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
the O

that O
is O
truly O
wonderful O
PUNCT O

enjoy O
that O
toshib O

i O
purchased O
this O

9 O
months O

PUNCT O

which O
is O
great O
i O
am O
running O

business E-POS

returning O

this O

we O
love O
the O
size B-POS
of I-POS
the I-POS
screen E-POS
PUNCT O
although O
it O
is O
still O
lightweight O
and O
very O
easy O
to O
tote S-POS
around O
PUNCT O

they O
are O
n't O
worth O
the O

PUNCT O
even O
though O
they O
are O
on O
the O
cheap O
side O
PUNCT O

speaking O
PUNCT O

either O
way O
the O
entire O
thing O
was O
just O
a O
joke O
PUNCT O
a O
complete O
rip O

so O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
computer O
does O
not O
work S-NEG
on O
the O
24 O
twenty O
fourth O
day O
is O
my O
fault O
PUNCT O

so O
glad O

i O

i O
thought O
i O

PUNCT O

the O

not O
keep O

and O
finally O
the O
hard B-NEG

went O
out O
PUNCT O

i O
could O
have O
purchased O
a O
cheap O

to O
do O
what O
i O
'm O
doing O
now O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
most O
impressed O
with O
the O

including O
the O

PUNCT O

i O
upgraded O
it O

PUNCT O
i O
am O
very O
happy O
with O
it O
PUNCT O

i O

PUNCT O
in O
december O
of O
2005 O
PUNCT O

dismantle O
the O
whole O
thing O
PUNCT O
then O
it O
will O
not O
be O
a O
newly O
manufactured O
set O
like O
before O
PUNCT O

they O
should O
have O
included O
more O

on O
their O

if O
they O
knew O

would O
run O
slowly O
PUNCT O

battery B-NEG
life E-NEG
could O
be O
better O
but O
overall O
for O
the O
price S-POS
and O
toshiba O
's O
reputation O
for O

it O
's O
great O
PUNCT O

it O
would O
n't O
fit O
in O
most O
17-inch O

PUNCT O

the O
first O
time O
it O
crashed O
was O
maybe O
going O
on O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
of O
having O
it O
PUNCT O

after O
the O
warrenty S-NEU
expired O
the O
hard B-NEG
drive E-NEG
went O
bad O
and O
it O
would O
have O
cost O
more O
to O
fix O
then O
to O
replace O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
small O
enough O
to O
fit O
in O
one O
of O
my O

PUNCT O

the O
windows B-POS
7 I-POS
starter E-POS
is O
PUNCT O
in O
my O
opinion O
PUNCT O
a O
great O
way O
to O
think O
about O
using O
your O
netbook O
PUNCT O
basics O
PUNCT O
basics O
PUNCT O
basics O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
very O
worried O
about O
making O
the O
two O
compatible O
but O
literally O
PUNCT O
it O
was O
so O
simple O
i O
was O
almost O
worried O
that O
i O
was O
doing O
something O
wrong O
PUNCT O

note O
that O
i O
do O
n't O
ordinarily O
take O
the O
time O
to O
write O
a O
review O
PUNCT O

i O
purchased O
this O
netbook O
after O
my O
original O
toshiba O
laptop O
crashed O
right O
after O
the O
warranty S-NEG
expired O
PUNCT O

apparently O
well-aspect2 O
and O
gorgeous O
to O
look S-POS
at O
PUNCT O
the O
i5 O
macbook O

is O
a O
winning O
combination O
of O
price S-POS
and O
performance S-POS
PUNCT O

asus O
has O
done O
an O
outstanding O
job O
of O
evolving O
their O
netbooks O
PUNCT O
and O
i O
would O
recommend O
this O
to O
anyone O
who O
both O
understands O
their O
needs O
and O
how O
netbooks O
can O
fit O
them O
PUNCT O

the O
apple B-POS
care E-POS
has O
never O
failed O
me O
PUNCT O
and O
i O
expect O
it O
to O
be O
the O
same O
for O
this O
computer O
as O
well O
PUNCT O

it O
has O
served O
my O
needs O
quite O
nicely O
for O
the O
most O
part O
PUNCT O

so O
i O
called O
compaq O
PUNCT O
and O
after O
being O
on O
the O

PUNCT O

i O
should O
n't O
have O
had O
a O
problem O
getting O
since O
it O

under O
warranty S-NEU
PUNCT O

so O
we O
exchanged O
it O
for O

after O
2 O
hours O
it O
did O
n't O
work S-NEG
PUNCT O

do O
not O
buy O
you O
will O
be O
disappointed O
PUNCT O

i O
just O
recently O
had O
to O
ship O
my O
laptop O
back O
to O
hp O
for O
repair O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
had O
to O
take O
it O
to O
the O
geek O
squad O
guys O
to O
get O
it O
fixed O
because O
it O
has O
had O
viruses O
3 O
times O
and O
i O
have O
not O
even O
had O
it O
for O
more O
then O
4 O
months O
PUNCT O

we O
do O
n't O
mind O
and O
you O
do O
n't O
matter O
PUNCT O

i O
love O
the O
size S-POS
PUNCT O
keyboard S-POS
PUNCT O
the O
functions S-POS
PUNCT O

but O
as O
time O
went O
on O
i O
found O
it O
almost O
impossible O
to O
keep O
the O
thing O
on-line O
through O
wi-fi O
PUNCT O

the O
mouse S-NEG
is O
way O
way O
way O
to O
sensitve O
PUNCT O

toshiba O
knows O
there O
is O
a O
manufacturing O
defect O
but O
will O
not O
acknowledge O
it O
PUNCT O

the O
os S-POS
is O
still O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
day O
that O
the O
laptop O
was O
purchased O
and O
continues O
to O
run S-POS
flawlessly O
PUNCT O

also O
PUNCT O
i O
issued O
a O
replacement O
rma O
for O
a O
few O
dead O
pixels O
in O
the O
upper O
zone O
of O
the O
screen S-NEG
PUNCT O
which O
is O
noticable O
to O
me O
PUNCT O

waited O
on O
getting O
this O
computer O
PUNCT O
but O
it O
has O
been O
a O
great O
change O
PUNCT O

after O
way O
too O
many O
times O
sending O
the O
thing O
in O
for O
repairs O
delivery B-NEG
service E-NEG
was O
slow O
PUNCT O
and O
without O
the O
laptop O
i O
had O
no O
access O
to O
the O
internet O
PUNCT O
and O
thus O
no O
way O
of O
tracking O
it O
to O
find O
out O
when O
i O
might O
hope O
to O
see O
my O
computer O
again O
PUNCT O
it O
finally O
kicked O
the O
bucket O
after O
just O
over O
2 O
years O
PUNCT O

my O
friend O
reports O
the O
notebook O
is O
astonishing O
in O
performance S-POS
PUNCT O
picture B-POS
quality E-POS
PUNCT O
and O
ease O
of O
use S-POS
PUNCT O

the O
i3 B-POS
processor E-POS
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
run O
hot O
and O
the O
fan S-POS
rarely O
turns O
on O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
getting O
extrememly O
frustrated O
when O
i O
would O
want O
to O
do O
these O
simple O
taks O
that O
i O
would O
have O
to O
wait O
and O
wait O
and O
wait O
for O
things O
to O
download O
or O
virus O
that O
would O
clog O
up O
my O
pc O
PUNCT O

enjoy O
your O
sitdown O

another O
three O
weeks O
later O
i O
had O
my O
laptop O
back O
with O
a O
new O
mousepad S-NEU
PUNCT O
keys S-NEU
PUNCT O
and O
casing S-NEU
PUNCT O

i O
have O
had O
my O
new O
macbook O
pro O
i5 O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
and O
have O
recycled O
all O
of O
my O
old O
pc O
laptops O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
do O
n't O
understand O
is O
that O
the O
resolution B-NEG
of I-NEG
the I-NEG
screen E-NEG
is O
n't O
high O
enough O
for O
some O
pages O
PUNCT O
such O
as O
yahoo O
PUNCT O
mail O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
wish O
this O
had O
was O
the O
option O
to O
turn O
off O
the O
touchpad S-NEG
with O
a O
button O
like O
my O
big O
16 O
laptop O
does O
PUNCT O

very O
convenient O
when O
you O
travel O
and O
the O
battery B-POS
life E-POS
is O
excellent O
PUNCT O

the O
machine O
is O
slow O
to O
boot B-NEG
up E-NEG
and O
occasionally O
crashes O
completely O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
great O
if O
you O
have O
several O
lectures O
back O
to O
back O
and O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
chance O
to O
charge S-POS
during O
one O
of O
the O
lectures O
PUNCT O

i O
wish O
toshiba O
would O
allow O
their O
customers O
to O
select O
an O
option O
that O
only O
boots O
the O
os S-NEU
at O
setup O
and O
removes O
all O
the O
unnecessary O
stuff O
PUNCT O

i O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
buy O
a O
generic O
brand O
computer O
but O
it O
is O
really O
nice O
PUNCT O

i O
can O
use O
it O
for O
all O
of O
my O
needs O
PUNCT O

after O
doing O
cad O
work O
all O
day O
at O
work O
PUNCT O
using O
a O
higher O

PUNCT O
i O
could O
n't O
come O
home O

and O
died O
after O
only O
2-years O
PUNCT O
10-months O
and O
18-days O
of O

PUNCT O

the O

is O
a O
bit O
quiet O
if O
you O
're O
on O
a O

PUNCT O
this O
can O
easily O
be O
overcome O
with O
a O

i O

PUNCT O

i O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
ever O
buying O

PUNCT O

the O

you O
have O
to O
press O
a O
little O
harder O
than O
most O
PUNCT O

the O
battery B-NEG
life E-NEG
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
6 O
hours O

but O
even O
if O
i O
ran O
off O
the O
battery S-NEU
with O
the O
high O
effeciency O

the O
battery S-NEU
would O
only O
last O

on O
average O
about O
25 O
to O
3 O
hours O

love O

i O
recommend O
them O
to O
the O

however O
this O
is O
just O
unacceptable O
PUNCT O

now O
17 O
months O
later O
they O
want O
would O
not O
say O
exact O
amount O
PUNCT O
16500 O
to O
PUNCT O
400 O
to O
fix O
the O
machine O
PUNCT O

i O
simply O
got O
tired O
of O
a O
bad O
computer O
like O
windows O
with O
its O
constant O
freezing O
and O
anti-virus O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
not O
one O
to O
throw O
things O
like O
this O
around O
but O
it O
is O
a O
laptop O
so O
carrying O
it O
around O
does O
seem O
to O
mean O
it O
will O
be O
jerked O
possibly O
a O
little O
PUNCT O
while O
driving O
a O
car O
and O
carrying O
it O
into O
where O
ever O
you O
are O
using O
it O
PUNCT O

right O
size S-POS
and O
weight S-POS
for O
portability S-POS
PUNCT O

we O
decided O
we O
would O
try O
to O
trade-in O
our O
old O
ones O
PUNCT O

so O
far O
PUNCT O
so O
good O
PUNCT O

it O
took O
a O
little O
over O
2 O
weeks O
until O
i O
got O
it O
back O
PUNCT O

eventually O
the O
screen O
went O
blank O
and O
the O
computer O
would O
not O
turn O
on O
PUNCT O

the O
battery B-NEG
life E-NEG
also O
does O
n't O
keep O
up O
with O
the O
claim O
but O
still O
i O
think O
macbook O
is O
much O
ahead O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
pack O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
loaded O
with O
windows B-NEU
vista I-NEU
home I-NEU
premium E-NEU
-- O
delivered O
with O
only O
1gb B-NEG
of I-NEG
ram E-NEG
PUNCT O
and O
it O
was O
a O
*dog* O
PUNCT O

what O
a O
waste O
of O
time O
it O
was O
to O
run O
a O
defrag O
on O
the O
pc O
PUNCT O

the O
reflectiveness O
of O
the O
display S-NEG
is O
only O
a O
minor O
inconvenience O
if O
you O
work O
in O
a O
controlled-lighting O
environment O
like O
me O
i O
prefer O
it O
dark O
or O
if O
you O
can O
crank O
up O
the O
brightness S-NEU
PUNCT O

my O
one O
complaint O
with O
this O
laptop O
is O
that O
i O
've O
noticed O
an O
electronic B-NEG
fuzz I-NEG
sound E-NEG
coming O
out O
of O
the O
headphone B-NEG
jack E-NEG
when O
headphones O
are O
plugged O
in O
PUNCT O

update O
PUNCT O
two O
years O
after O
buying O
this O
laptop O
PUNCT O
i O
am O
now O
the O
proud O
owner O
of O
a O
lemon O
PUNCT O

while O
it O
was O
highly O
rated O
PUNCT O
would O
i O
like O
it O
PUNCT O
i O
tried O
the O
keyboard S-NEU
at O
the O
store O
PUNCT O
and O
it O
seemed O
ok O
PUNCT O

treat O
yourself O
to O
a O
more O
expensive O
PUNCT O
long-lasting O
laptop O
of O
quality S-POS
like O
a O
sony O
PUNCT O
apple O
PUNCT O
or O
toshiba O
PUNCT O

i O
love O
it O
PUNCT O
never O
had O
a O
computer O
i O
was O
so O
impressed O
with O
PUNCT O
and O
i O
've O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
laptops O
and O
desktops O
PUNCT O
this O
one O
is O
far O
and O
above O
the O
best O
one O
i O
ever O
had O
before O
PUNCT O

we O
did O
not O
even O
have O
it O
a O
year O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
had O
to O
call O
with O
a O
few O
questions O
or O
issues O
and O
they O
have O
helped O
me O
for O
free O
PUNCT O
even O
without O
the O
warranty S-NEU
PUNCT O

so O
you O
out O
of O
of O
notebook O
and O
money O
PUNCT O

was O
searching O
online O
for O
a O
power B-NEU
supply E-NEU
when O
i O
found O
this O
site O
PUNCT O

but O
to O
be O
honest O
PUNCT O
i O
do O
n't O
use O
my O
computer O
for O
anything O
like O
graphics B-NEU
editing E-NEU
and O
complex B-NEU
data I-NEU
analysis E-NEU
and O
gaming S-NEU
PUNCT O

i O
would O
rather O
spend O
my O
money O
on O
a O
computer O
that O
costs S-NEG
more O
then O
a O
toshiba O
that O
is O
n't O
good O
at O
all O
PUNCT O

no O
problem O
with O
the O
ordering O
or O
shipping S-POS
by O
the O
way O
PUNCT O

and O
the O
ram S-POS
the O
thing O
that O
makes O
it O
faster O
comes O
sporting O
2 O
gigs O
for O
high O
performance S-POS
to O
handle O
more O
stuff O
at O
once O
and O
surf B-POS
the I-POS
web E-POS
a O
whole O
lot O
faster O
than O
before O
PUNCT O

the O
one O
thing O
i O
wish O
it O
had O
was O
a O
detailed O
hardcopy B-NEG
manuel E-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
edit O
and O
burn O
to O
dvd O
a O
lot O
of O

so O
i O
obviously O
could O
not O
live O
with O
a O
non-functioning O

PUNCT O

fast O
PUNCT O
great O
visual S-POS
PUNCT O

it O
's O
priced S-POS
very O
reasonable O

works S-POS
very O
well O
right O
out O

the O

PUNCT O

you O
will O
need O
them O
if O
you O
want O
to O
reload O
the O

i O
recommend O
doing O
if O
you O
can O
to O
start O

optimal O
PUNCT O

apple O

quess O
what O
PUNCT O
you O
have O
to O

the O

too O
bad O
PUNCT O
so O
sad O

if O
you O
could O
stretch O

a O
few O
100 O

i O
highly O
recommend O
you O
should O
replace O
your O

this O
one O
PUNCT O

might O
have O
to O
buy O
one O
for O

while O
the O

alright O
PUNCT O
the O

i O

we O
paid O
for O
the O
three B-NEU
year I-NEU

and O
the O
extended B-NEU
warranty E-NEU
after O
that O
one O
ended O
as O
well O
PUNCT O

its O
not O
just O
slow O
on O
the O
internet S-NEG
PUNCT O
its O
slow O
in O
general O
PUNCT O

it O
has O
just O
enough O
ram S-POS
to O
run O
smoothly O
and O
enough O
memory S-POS
to O
satisfy O
my O
needs O
PUNCT O

the O
difference O
is O
phenomenal O
PUNCT O

i O
acually O
believe O
the O
issue O
is O
with O
the O
nvidia B-NEG
grafics I-NEG
card E-NEG
PUNCT O
but O
still O
requires O
a O
return O

no O
waiting O

did O

my O

my O
husband O
got O
me O
this O
for O
chrismas O
after O
getting O
me O
a O
very O
expensve O
laptop O
that O
did O
not O
work S-NEG
after O
2 O
days O
PUNCT O

problem O
fixed O
which O
is O
great O
but O
there O
went O
another O
two O
weeks O
without O
my O
laptop O
at O
school O
PUNCT O

the O
resolution S-POS
is O
even O
higher O
then O
any O
other O
laptop O
on O
the O
market O
PUNCT O

then O
just O
the O
other O
day O
PUNCT O
my O
left B-NEG
"mouse" I-NEG
button E-NEG
snapped O
PUNCT O

laptop O
is O
advertised O
as O
a O
15" S-NEU
but O
the O
casing S-NEG
looks O
like O
that O
of O
a O
17" S-NEU
PUNCT O

remember O
to O
do O
your O
research O
first O
before O
consider O
buying O
a O
toshiba O
product O
PUNCT O

i O
bought O
this O
laptop O
the O
moment O
unibody O
product O
came O
to O
the O
market O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
time O
i O
have O
restarted O
is O
during O
system O
updates O
PUNCT O

mac O
is O
extremely O
different O
than O
any O
other O
laptop O
PUNCT O

in O
due O
course O
PUNCT O
i O
'll O
remove O
the O
hard B-NEG
disc E-NEG
from O
this O
new O
macbook O
pro O
and O
dump O
it O
where O
it O
belongs O
PUNCT O
in O
the O
trash O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
great O
and O
we O
will O
always O
stick O
with O
apple O
computers O
PUNCT O
we O
have O
been O
so O
happy O
with O
them O
PUNCT O

i O
should O
have O
realized O
that O
trouble O
was O
brewing O
PUNCT O

they O
break O
down O
just O
as O
often O
as O
pcs O
do O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
only O
reason O
they O
do O
n't O
get O
viruses O
PUNCT O
is O
because O
no O
one O
makes O
viruses O
for O
them O
PUNCT O
they O
're O
not O
better O
in O
any O
way O
PUNCT O
they O
are O
worse O
PUNCT O
try O
finding O
virus B-NEG
protection I-NEG
programs I-NEG
for I-NEG
a I-NEG
mac E-NEG
PUNCT O
they O
do O
n't O
exist O
PUNCT O

the O
benefits O
were O
immediate O
PUNCT O

much O
faster O
than O
my O
old O
windows O
laptop O
that O
died O
on O
me O
PUNCT O

never O
any O
doubt O
i O
would O
get O
a O
macbook O
PUNCT O
just O
was O
n't O
sure O
which O
one O
PUNCT O

but O
with O
a O
way O
bigger O
screen S-POS
PUNCT O
and O
is O
able O
to O
connect O
to O
an O
hdmi S-NEU
PUNCT O

the O
graphics S-NEG
are O
awful O
and O
the O
wireless B-NEG
switch E-NEG
it O
at O
the O
top O
rather O
than O
the O
side O
which O
i O
am O
used O
to O
it O
being O
on O
the O
side O
PUNCT O

the O
overall O
build B-POS
quality E-POS
of O
the O
unit O
is O
excellent O
and O
she O
'd O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
else O
looking O
for O
a O
netbook O
PUNCT O

i O
bought O
my O
acer O
aspire O
custom O
made O
in O
june O
2008 O
PUNCT O

i O
guess O
he O
was O
the O
technical B-NEU
person E-NEU
PUNCT O

they O
click O
PUNCT O

a O
seventy O
dollar O
mouse S-NEU
PUNCT O

the O
repairs O
were O
made O
quickly O
though O
i O
must O
say O
PUNCT O
however O
the O
second O
time O
they O
shipped S-NEG
it O
to O
the O
incorrect O
address O
and O
it O
took O
nearly O
a O
week O
for O
them O
to O
get O
it O
to O
me O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
the O
a65 O
PUNCT O
right O
now O
it O
's O
a O
paperweight O
PUNCT O

when O
i O
first O
got O
it O
i O
thought O
the O
size S-NEG
of O
it O
was O
a O
joke O
PUNCT O

that O
being O
said O
PUNCT O
it O
still O
runs O
video O
in O
full O
screen O
decently O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
fast O
and O
i O
have O
not O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
internet B-POS
connection E-POS
or O
any O
other O
problems O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
really O
impressed O
with O
the O
quality S-POS
and O
performance S-POS
for O
the O
price S-POS
of O
the O
computer O
PUNCT O

but O
when O
i O
received O
my O
replacement O
PUNCT O
i O
made O
both O
recovery B-NEU
dvds E-NEU
4 O
PUNCT O
and O
a O
driver/application B-NEU
dvd E-NEU
PUNCT O

in O
addition O
PUNCT O
there O
is O
photo B-POS
detection I-POS
software E-POS
that O
will O
allow O
you O
to O
group O
all O
the O
photos O
together O
based O
upon O
the O
people O
in O
the O
picture O
PUNCT O

the O
speakers S-NEG
are O
terrible O
and O
are O
probably O
the O
cheapest O
ones O
i O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
a O
laptop O
so O
if O
your O
planning O
to O
listen O
to O
music O
i O
suggest O
you O
get O
something O
better O
PUNCT O

so O
then O
you O
may O
be O
lucky O
to O
get O
ahold O
to O
someone O
who O
understands O
that O
its O
no O
good O
and O
they O
will O
let O
you O
send O
it O
back O
PUNCT O
but O
of O
course O
you O
are O
taking O
a O
chance O
of O
them O
testing O
it O
out O
to O
see O
what O
has O
happened O
PUNCT O
and O
they O
tell O
you O
that O
it O
was O
not O
on O
their O
side O
PUNCT O
then O
you O
are O
stuck O
paying O
for O
the O
repair O
the O
price S-NEG
of O
a O
new O
one O
PUNCT O

what O
's O
really O
great O
about O
this O
product O
is O
you O
may O
have O
a O
family O
member O
who O
is O
computer O
illiterate O
and O
you O
can O
pretty O
much O
just O
let O
them O
loose O
on O
this O
computer O
without O
any O
real O
supervision O
PUNCT O

the O
lesson O
learned O
here O
is O
PUNCT O
it O
does O
not O
pay O
to O
by O
this O
loyal O
to O
any O
brand O
PUNCT O
since O
all O
of O
them O
are O
there O
to O
simply O
to O
make O
as O
much O
money O
as O
possible O
PUNCT O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
can O
PUNCT O
and O
in O
this O
day O
and O
age O
PUNCT O
the O
customer O
no O

right O
all O

almost O
four O
years O
now O
and O
i O
have O
only O
had O
a O
few O
problems O
with O
it O
PUNCT O

overall O
for O
the O
money O
this O
is O
a O
good O
deal O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
so O
simple O
to O
use S-POS
PUNCT O
i O
use S-POS
it O
more O
than O
my O
desktop O
PUNCT O

i O
also O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
the O

that O
caused O
the O

all O
over O

PUNCT O

i O
own O

PUNCT O

either O
way O
PUNCT O
the O

unsatisfactory O
PUNCT O

well O
PUNCT O
i O
have O
to O
say O
since O
i O
bought O
my O
mac O
PUNCT O
i O
wo O
n't O
ever O
go O
back O

PUNCT O

i O
took O
it O
in O
to O
the O
apple O

guess O
what O
PUNCT O
they O
fixed O
it O
PUNCT O
no O
cost S-NEG
out O
of O

PUNCT O

i O
love O
the O
mac O
so O
much O
better O
than O
my O
work O
pc O
PUNCT O

i O
recommend O
the O
macbook O
pro O
if O
you O
want O
the O
best O
laptop O
on O
the O
market O
PUNCT O

the O
applications S-POS
are O
also O
very O
easy O
to O
find O
and O
maneuver O
PUNCT O
much O
easier O
than O
any O
other O
computer O
i O
have O
ever O
owned O

the O

gives O
you O
the O
option O
to O
comfortably O
watch O

the O
only O
thing O
that O
is O
n't O
perfect O
about O
this O

is O
the O
speakers S-NEG
PUNCT O
they O
are O
not O
loud O

i O
expected O
that O

bought O

of O

PUNCT O
i O
inspected O
the O
other O
netbooks O
and O
clearly O
their O
hinges S-NEG
are O
tighter O
and O
i O
even O
demonstrate O
the O
difference O
between O
my O
netbook O
and O
others O
PUNCT O

not O
to O
mention O
the O
fact O
that O
your O
mac O
comes O
fully O
loaded O
with O
all O
necessary O
basic O
programs S-POS
PUNCT O

did O
n't O
work S-NEG
when O

*6th O

have O
an O
option O
to O
save O
your O

PUNCT O
which O
really O
eliminates O
the O
need O
for O
the O
actual O
PUNCT O

the O
best O
thing O
to O
do O
is O
build O
your O
own O
computer O
PUNCT O
but O
if O
u O
ca O
n't O
company O
's O
like O
dell O
who O
allow O
you O
to O
choose O
the O
components S-POS
are O
better O
and O
for O
the O
same O
price S-POS
you O
can O
get O
a O
computer O
who O
compares O
to O
one O
of O
apple O
PUNCT O
2000 O
systems O
and O
if O
you O
google O
dell O
coupons O
you O
can O
find O
codes O
that O
take O
a O
signifant O
amount O
off O
the O
price S-POS
PUNCT O

there O
is O
no O
cd B-NEG
drive E-NEG
on O
the O
computer O
PUNCT O
which O
defeats O
the O
purpose O
of O
keeping O
files O
on O
a O

PUNCT O

and O
toshiba O
is O
a O
quality O
supplier O
PUNCT O

for O
me O
i O
was O
lucky O
and O
a O
local O
store O
was O
selling O
them O
for O
PUNCT O
2000 O
off O
and O
best O
buy O
matched O
their O
price S-POS
so O
i O
was O
able O
to O
buy O
one O
for O
under O
PUNCT O
1000 O

i O
ca O
n't O
honestly O
say O
i O
was O
heartbroken O
PUNCT O

will O
not O
every O
buy O
another O

-- O
-- O
-- O
lou O

unfortunately O
PUNCT O
apple O
's O
quality S-NEG
has O
continued O
to O
slide O
PUNCT O

and O
finally O
i O
realized O
that O
mac O
is O
the O
best O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
very O
annoying O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
hoping O
that O
i O
can O
find O
a O
really O
quick O
way O
to O
clean O
it O
without O
it O
getting O
too O
gross O
PUNCT O

my O
only O
other O
complaint O
is O
that O
it O
gets O
really O
hot O
PUNCT O

i O
believe O
that O
the O
quality S-POS
of O
a O
mac O
is O
worth O
the O
price S-POS
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
very O
disappointed O
in O
dell O
PUNCT O

sometimes O
you O
will O
be O
moving O
your O
finger O
and O
the O
pointer S-NEG
will O
not O
even O
move O
PUNCT O

i O
've O
only O
had O
mine O
a O
day O
but O
i O
'm O
already O
used O
to O
it O
PUNCT O

and O
that O
was O
the O
fourth O
time O
ive O
sent O
it O
to O
them O
to O
get O
fixed O
PUNCT O

the O
13 O
macbook O
pro O
just O
fits O
in O
my O
budget S-POS
and O
with O
free O
shipping S-POS
and O
no O
tax O
to O
ca O
this O
is O
the O
best O
price S-POS
we O
can O
get O
for O
a O
great O
product O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
rate O
this O
computer O
at O
5 O
stars O
PUNCT O
but O
considering O
it O
has O
a O
short O
life B-NEG
span E-NEG
i O
can O
only O
give O
it O
1 O
and O
implore O
anyone O
looking O
at O
laptops O
to O
stay O
away O
from O
this O
machine O
PUNCT O

i O
also O
love O
the O
design S-POS
PUNCT O
the O
looks S-POS
PUNCT O
the O
feel S-POS
PUNCT O
and O
the O
my B-POS
toshiba I-POS
feature E-POS
is O
wonderfull O
PUNCT O

for O
me O
PUNCT O
five O
stars O
is O
not O
enough O
PUNCT O

i O
love O
how O
easy O
every O
thing O
is O
to O
do O
on O
my O
apple O
products O
PUNCT O

sadly O
apple O
has O
discontinued O
this O
macbook O
PUNCT O
i O
think O
it O
was O
never O
super O
popular O
since O
it O
fell O
somewhere O
in O
between O
the O
cheapest O
white O
model O
and O
the O
smaller O
pros O
PUNCT O

the O
layout S-NEG
of O
the O
macbook O
is O
horrible O
and O
confusing O
PUNCT O

was O
not O
happy O
with O
one B-NEG
of I-NEG
the I-NEG
programs E-NEG
on O
it O
PUNCT O

also O
it O
is O
very O
good O
for O
college O

who O
just O
need O
a O

definitely O
a O

is O
that O
if O

PUNCT O

the O

taking O

PUNCT O

i O
also O
did O

it O

how O
the O

with O

which O
you O
ca O
n't O
find O
a O

the O
fact O
that O
the O

worse O
PUNCT O
for O
the O

i O
could O
get O
a O
*netbook* O
that O

this O

PUNCT O

it O
had O
most O
of O

all O

that O

wanted O

replace O
my O

this O

PUNCT O

it O

i O
expected O
it O
to O
have O
PUNCT O

just O
a O

on O
the O
phone-visited O
machouse O
PUNCT O
they O
stated O
the O
their O
call B-NEG
center E-NEG
is O
down O
due O
to O
too O
many O
phonecalls O
difficult O
to O
believe O
PUNCT O

there O
is O
a O
backlit B-POS
keyboard E-POS
which O
is O
perfect O
for O
typing O
in O

problem O
with O

PUNCT O
so O
it O
's O
not O
just O
an O
isolated O
incident O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

they O
had O
me O
send O
in O

last O

all O

w-o-w O
PUNCT O

i O
love O
this O

PUNCT O
it O
is O
superior O
to O
windows B-NEG
movie I-NEG

PUNCT O

which O
is O
what O
i O
did O
PUNCT O
check O
out O
my O

PUNCT O

he O
has O
replaced O
his O

this O
purchase O
opened O
me O
to O
the O
world O
of O
macbooks O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
impressed O
with O
the O
intuition O
of O
the O
design S-POS
PUNCT O
the O
beauty S-POS
of O
the O
product O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
excellent O

it O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
loved O
this O
since O
i O
took O
it O
out O
of O
the O
box O
PUNCT O

but O
PUNCT O
like O
i O
said O
before O
PUNCT O
the O
only O
reason O
i O
do O
n't O
currently O
have O
a O
mac O
laptop O
is O
because O
all O
of O
their O
laptops O
are O
too O
pricey O
PUNCT O

i O
've O
also O
had O
to O
have O
the O
keyboard S-NEG
replaced O
at O
my O
expense O
PUNCT O

i O
had O
the O
staff S-NEG
telling O
me O
older O
version O
did O
not O
make O
the O
fan B-NEG
noise E-NEG
cause O
it O
is O
a O
different O
computer O
PUNCT O

was O
very O
much O
worth O
the O
price S-POS
i O
paid O
PUNCT O

so O
far O
PUNCT O
so O
good O
PUNCT O

even O
out O
of O
warranty S-NEU
PUNCT O

this O
is O
a O
great O
little O
computer O
for O
the O
price S-POS
PUNCT O

this O
comes O
in O
very O
handy O
for O
me O
as O
an O
educator O
PUNCT O

crisp O
screen S-POS
PUNCT O
great O
battery B-POS
life E-POS
PUNCT O
and O
plenty O
of O
storage S-POS
PUNCT O

it O
's O
a O
long O
and O
tirring O
process O
that O
after O
a O
while O
it O
seems O
like O
their O
game O
plan O
was O
to O
wear O
you O
out O
so O
you O
would O
want O
to O
give O

PUNCT O

all O
apple B-POS
associates E-POS
are O
always O
wiling O
to O

no O

when O

how O

i O
think O
that O
anyone O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
durrable O
laptop O
then O
this O
is O
the O
way O
to O
go O
PUNCT O

also O
PUNCT O
my O
sister O
got O
the O
exact O
same O
laptop O
since O
they O
were O
so O
cheap O
and O
after O
8 O
months O
PUNCT O
the O
screen S-NEG
split O
in O
half O
just O
from O
everyday O
use O
PUNCT O

it O
started O
out O
getting O
hot O
after O
only O
a O
few O
months O
PUNCT O

the O
toshiba O
satellite O
has O
been O
more O
than O
i O
expected O
for O
the O
price S-POS
PUNCT O

i O
had O
to O
adjust O
my O
mousepad B-NEG
sensitivity E-NEG
PUNCT O
because O
it O
is O
very O
sensitive O
PUNCT O

i O
wish O
iwork S-NEG
or O
ms B-NEG
office E-NEG
came O
with O
the O

PUNCT O
but O
ms B-NEG
office E-NEG
does O
n't O
even O
come O
with O
most O
pc O
laptops O
PUNCT O

to O
my O
mind O
much O
more O
usable O
than O
the O
toy O
called O
an O
ipad O
PUNCT O

it O
allows O
me O
to O
do O
everything O
i O
need O
from O
a O
computer O
and O
more O
PUNCT O

keyboard S-NEG
is O
plastic O
and O
spongey O
feeling O
PUNCT O

which O
apple O
does O
n't O
offer O
PUNCT O
is O
why O
i O
bought O
my O
macbook O
at O
best O
buy O
PUNCT O

previous O
laptops O
were O
pc O
's O
PUNCT O
still O

them O
PUNCT O

the O

osx E-POS
is O
a O
clean O

PUNCT O

the O
computer O
is O
a O

true O
PUNCT O

i O
also O
love O
having O
the O
extra O

set O
up O
on O
the O
keyboard S-POS
which O
most O
laptops O
do O
not O
have O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
glad O
i O
made O
the O
choice O
to O
switch O
and O
buy O
this O
mac O
PUNCT O

because O
he O
said O
that O
the O
hinge S-NEG
is O
under O
the O
motherboard S-NEU
and O
they O
have O
to O
dismantle O
the O
whole O
thing O
before O
it O
can O
be O
tightened O
PUNCT O

you O
can O
do O
it O
all O
on O
this O
bad O
boy O
but O
the O
main O
thing O
this O
netbook O
was O
desinged O
for O
was O
surfing B-POS
the I-POS

and O
boy O
o O
boy O
does O
it O
ever O
PUNCT O

i O
love O
my O
apple O
PUNCT O
it O
is O
quick O
and O
easy O
to O
use S-POS
PUNCT O

did O
n't O
expect O
to O
repair O
it O
at O
once O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
quiet O
and O
a O
real O
joy O
to O
watch O
work O
PUNCT O

with O
notes O
saying O
they O
replaced O
the O
hard B-NEU
drive E-NEU
PUNCT O

the O
laptop O
is O
relatively O
simple O
to O
use S-POS
PUNCT O
though O
i O
bought O
macs O
for O
dummies O
PUNCT O
which O
is O
well O
worth O
PUNCT O
2 O

ca O
n't O
close O
the O

bay E-NEG
since O
there O
are O

then O
PUNCT O
it O

very O
very O

if O
you O

the O

something O
for O
you O
too O
PUNCT O

i O
had O
to O
have O
these O

PUNCT O

thus O
PUNCT O
when O
you O
carry O
it O
at O
a O
slanted O

PUNCT O
the O

will O
topple O
or O

again O

i O
was O
so O

said O
i O
could O
get O
a O

PUNCT O

we O
purchased O
this O

a O
back O

after O
our O
more O

all O
