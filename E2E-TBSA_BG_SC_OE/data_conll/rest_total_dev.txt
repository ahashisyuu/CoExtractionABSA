PUNCT O
the O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
was O
the O

PUNCT O
which O

could O
n't O
make O
up O
for O
all O
the O

want O
to O
try O
the O

really O
also O
the O

PUNCT O
is O
good O
and O
the O

PUNCT O

suan O

it O

i O
suggest O
only O
eating O

well O
with O
the O

PUNCT O

odd O
for O

PUNCT O

this O

definitely O
an O
excellent O
date O

because O
of O
the O

on O

enough O
PUNCT O

in O

a O
while O

PUNCT O

the O
staff S-POS
has O
always O
been O
friendly O
without O
seeming O
grating O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
chef S-POS
has O
greeted O
us O
on O
a O
couple O
of O
occasions O
PUNCT O

the O
place S-NEG
is O
small O
and O
cramped O
but O
the O
food S-POS
is O
fantastic O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
concern O
i O
have O
is O
with O
the O
slighly O
all-business O
waitstaff S-NEG
who O
order O
and O
throw O
the O
food S-NEU
down O
PUNCT O
rushing O
you O
out O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
the O
pinnacle O
of O
indian B-POS
fast I-POS
food E-POS
all O
fast O
foods O
in O
my O
opinion O
PUNCT O

the O
service S-POS
was O
attentive O
PUNCT O
yet O
discreet O
PUNCT O

you O
have O
to O
increase O
the O
service S-NEG
a O
lot O
PUNCT O

ambiance S-NEG
is O
barely O
romantic O
but O
management S-POS
tries O
PUNCT O

if O
i O
wanted O
to O
deal O
with O
a O
crappy O
scene S-NEG
and O
annoying O
customers S-NEG
i O
'd O
go O
out O
in O
manhattan O
PUNCT O

bravissimo O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

found O
service S-POS
above O
average O
PUNCT O
but O
that O
could O
be O
because O
we O
were O
13 O
of O
us O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
to O
die O
for O
PUNCT O

fine O
dining O
restaurant O
quality S-POS
PUNCT O

the O
waitresses S-POS
are O
nice O
-- O
also O
you O
can O
just O
get O
counter B-POS
service E-POS
sit O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
get O
a O

PUNCT O
so O
if O
you O
ever O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
go O
here O
for O
dinner S-POS
PUNCT O
do O
not O
pass O
it O
up O
PUNCT O

the O
puke O

leave O
a O
lot O
to O
be O
desired O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
food S-POS
is O
very O
good O
PUNCT O

the O
hanger B-NEG
steak E-NEG
was O
like O
rubber O

the O

PUNCT O

no O
food S-NEU

PUNCT O

i O

with O
a O

at O
the O

PUNCT O

it O
can O
be O
a O
little O
confusing O
as O
to O
where O
one O

to O
order O
PUNCT O
but O
once O
the O

whining O
so O
much O
PUNCT O

the O
food S-POS
is O
consistently O
wonderful O
PUNCT O
i O
've O

cooked O
perfectly O
PUNCT O

for O
years O
PUNCT O
i O
thought O
tuscan O

the O
best O
PUNCT O

salvatore O
converted O
me O
to O
the O
hearty O
neapolitan B-POS
fare E-POS
on O
my O
first O
visit O
PUNCT O

from O
the O
moment O
we O
walked O

even O
though O
the O
place S-NEG
was O
packed O
PUNCT O

the O
food S-POS
is O
definitely O
good O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
left O
a O
bit O
disappointed O
PUNCT O

the O
atmosphere S-NEU
is O
nothing O
special O
PUNCT O

it O
feels O
like O
a O

the O

PUNCT O

faan O

good O
PUNCT O

we O
saw O

i O
'm O
not O
sure O
which O
dim B-NEG

dish E-NEG
it O
was O
PUNCT O

the O
fish S-POS
is O
fresh O
and O
each O
piece O
is O
sliced O
to O

and O
seasoned O
by O
the O
sushi B-POS
chef E-POS
usually O
with O
a O
little O
fresh O
wasabi S-POS

also O
sometimes O
with O
some O

PUNCT O

my O

PUNCT O

when O
we O
notified O
him O
that O
he O
did O
n't O
mention O
the O

PUNCT O
he O
did O
n't O
apologize O
but O
let O
us O
know O
that O
we O
made O
a O
very O
good O
decision O
regardless O
PUNCT O

kenny O
the O
owner S-POS
is O
always O
there O
and O
he O
treats O
my O
family O
like O
we O
are O
part O
of O
his O
family O
PUNCT O

they O
need O
a O
kick O
out O
of O
it O
but O
until O
then O
the O
sushi S-POS
is O
pretty O
good O
and O
the O
place S-POS
is O
consistent O
PUNCT O

for O
appetizers S-NEU
PUNCT O
i O
recommend O
the O
shrimp B-POS
fritters E-POS
and O
dumplings S-POS
PUNCT O

and O

i O
would O
recommend O
this O

to O
anyone O

would O
without O
a O

come O
again O
PUNCT O

deliveries S-NEG
often O
take O

the O

are O
higher O

most O
other O
pizzerias O
in O
the O

PUNCT O

i O
'm O
just O
reading O
some O
of O
these O
reviews O
and O
its O
nonsense O
that O
people O
are O
reviewing O
some O
places O
because O
it O
was O
too O
loud O
PUNCT O

because O
of O
the O
delicate O
thin O

PUNCT O
take-out B-NEG
pies E-NEG
get O

in O
their O

PUNCT O

i O
suspect O
this O
restaurant O
is O
what O
rao O

would O
be O
if O
it O
had O
n't O
turned O
exclusive O
PUNCT O

but O
that O
is O
highly O

PUNCT O

the O

pretty O
empty O
hmmm O

are O
to O

time O
PUNCT O

we O
