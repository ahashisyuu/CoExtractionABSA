the O

so O
horrible O
to O
us O
PUNCT O

the O
food S-POS
is O
uniformly O
exceptional O
PUNCT O
with O
a O
very O
capable O
kitchen S-POS
which O
will O
proudly O
whip O
up O
whatever O
you O
feel O
like O
eating O
PUNCT O
whether O
it O

not O
only O
was O
the O
food S-POS
outstanding O
PUNCT O

the O
little O
perks S-POS
were O
great O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
very O
overpriced O
and O
not O
very O
tasty O
PUNCT O

our O
agreed O
favorite O
is O
the O
orrechiete B-POS
with I-POS
sausage I-POS
and I-POS
chicken E-POS
usually O
the O
waiters S-POS
are O
kind O
enough O
to O
split O
the O
dish S-NEU
in O
half O
so O
you O
get O
to O
sample O
both O
meats S-NEU
PUNCT O

the O
bagels S-POS
have O
an O
outstanding O
taste O
with O
a O
terrific O
texture O
PUNCT O
both O
chewy O
yet O
not O
gummy O
PUNCT O

nevertheless O
the O
food S-POS
itself O
is O
pretty O
good O
PUNCT O

an O
omelet S-NEU
PUNCT O
below O

the O

was O
so O
over O
cooked O
it O
crumbled O
on O
the O
plate S-NEU
when O
you O
touched O
it O
PUNCT O

it O
took O
half O
an O
hour O
to O
get O
our O
check S-NEU
PUNCT O
which O
was O
perfect O
since O
we O
could O
sit O
PUNCT O
have O

the O

i O
'm O
a O
night O
person O

the O
most O
annoying O
thing O
PUNCT O
though O
PUNCT O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
servers S-NEG
seem O
to O
be O
trained O
to O
drive O
revenue O
PUNCT O

get O

its O
just O
the O
most O
tender O

ever O
PUNCT O

everything O
we O
had O
was O
pretty O
good O
PUNCT O
but O
we O
have O
only O
been O
there O
once O
PUNCT O

we O
were O
still O
sitting O
at O
the O
bar S-NEU
while O
we O
drank O
the O
sangria S-NEU
PUNCT O
but O
facing O
away O
from O
the O
bar S-NEU
when O
we O
turned O
back O
around O
PUNCT O
the O
PUNCT O
2 O
was O
gone O
the O
people O
next O
to O
us O
said O
the O

took O
it O
PUNCT O

something O
about O
them O
being O
busy O
with O
holiday O

PUNCT O

i O
would O
highly O

PUNCT O

this O

is O
great O
PUNCT O

the O
drinks S-POS
are O
amazing O
and O
half O
off O
till O
8pm O
PUNCT O

i O
've O
been O
back O
to O
nha O

literally O
a O
hundred O
times O
for O
the O
beef B-POS
cubes E-POS
PUNCT O
they O
're O
that O
good O
PUNCT O

with O
so O
many O
poor O
experiences O
to O
be O
had O
in O
the O
theater O

PUNCT O
is O
truly O
an O
excellent O
find O
PUNCT O

the O
service S-POS
PUNCT O
wine B-POS
selection E-POS
PUNCT O
ambiance S-POS
are O
all O
outstanding O
and O
deserve O
recognition O
PUNCT O

went O
there O
last O
night O
for O
2 O
year O
anniversery O
PUNCT O
and O
was O
n't O
all O
that O
impressed O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
rather O
pathetic O
that O
it O
took O
them O
over O
an O
hour O
to O
seat O
us O
PUNCT O

we O
were O
seated O
promptly O
as O
we O
had O
reservations S-POS
PUNCT O
however O
after O
that O
the O
service S-NEG
was O
slow O
PUNCT O

at O
first O
i O
was O
slightly O
skeptical O
because O
it O
was O
a O
sushi O
restaurant O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
nyc O
PUNCT O

the O
food O
was O
pretty O
good O
PUNCT O
but O
a O
little O
flavorless O
and O
the O
portions S-NEG
very O
small O
PUNCT O
including O
dessert S-NEG
PUNCT O

we O
visit O
at O
least O
once O
a O
month O
PUNCT O

also O
PUNCT O
the O
place O
is O
popular O
with O
families O
PUNCT O
so O
if O
you O
're O
bothered O
by O
children O
running O
loose O
like O
wild O
animals O
PUNCT O
come O
later O
at O
night O
to O
avoid O
them O
PUNCT O

i O
'll O
keep O
this O
short O
PUNCT O

i O
felt O
as O
though O
i O
were O
eating O
in O
paris O
PUNCT O

lived O
in O
shanghai O
most O
of O
my O
life O
and O
thought O
the O
food S-POS
was O
comparable O
to O
the O
flagship O
green O
bo O
restaurant O
there O
PUNCT O

i O
highly O
recommend O
cafe O
st O
bart O
's O
for O
their O
food S-POS
PUNCT O
the O
ambience S-POS
and O
wonderful O
service S-POS
PUNCT O

however O
PUNCT O
it O
's O
not O
worth O
a O
special O
trip O
PUNCT O

nice O
value O
PUNCT O

gigino O
's O
in O
wagner O
park O
is O
so O
enjoyable O
PUNCT O

and O
it O
was O
quick O
which O
is O
very O
important O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
a O
nice O
restaurant O
if O
you O

looking O
for O
a O
good O
place O
to O
host O
an O
intimate O
dinner B-NEU
meeting E-NEU
with O

PUNCT O

the O
food S-POS
here O
does O
a O
great O
service O
to O
the O
name O
cantonese S-POS
that O
is O
PUNCT O

but O
PUNCT O
nothing O
stands O
out O
about O
the O
cooking S-NEU
PUNCT O

joya O
used O
to O
be O
a O
cool O
spot O
with O
decent O
food S-POS
and O
a O
colorful O
PUNCT O
if O
not O
relaxed O
PUNCT O
atmosphere S-POS
PUNCT O

if O
that O
's O
a O
problem O
PUNCT O
go O
to O
mcdonald O

destroy O
your O

PUNCT O

the O
prix B-POS
fixe I-POS
menu E-POS

worth O
every O

and O
you O
get O
more O

enough O
both O
in O

and O
quality S-POS
PUNCT O

i O
've O
been O
here O
3 O
times O
for O
lunch S-NEU
and O
it O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorites O
in O
the O
city O
PUNCT O

i O
had O
their O
eggs B-NEG
benedict E-NEG
for O
brunch S-NEU
PUNCT O
which O
were O
the O
worst O
in O
my O
entire O
life O
PUNCT O
i O
tried O
removing O
the O
hollondaise B-NEG
sauce E-NEG
completely O
that O
was O
how O
failed O
it O
was O
PUNCT O

i O
work O
near-by O
PUNCT O
and O
they O
have O
the O
best O
oatmeal S-POS
in O
the O
neighborhood O
not O
a O
packaged O
or O
quick-cooked O
item O
PUNCT O

always O
busy O
but O
fast O
moving O
PUNCT O

too O
bad O
the O
food S-NEG
was O
n't O
of O
the O
same O
heritage O
PUNCT O

the O
menu S-POS
looked O
good O
PUNCT O
except O
for O
offering O
the O
chilean B-NEG
sea I-NEG
bass E-NEG
PUNCT O
but O
the O
server S-NEG
does O
not O
offer O
up O
the O
specials S-NEU
that O
were O
written O
on O
the O
board O
outside O
PUNCT O

sexy O
PUNCT O

the O
food S-POS
was O
really O
good O
PUNCT O
i O
had O
the O
onion B-POS
soup E-POS
and O
it O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
ever O
PUNCT O

i O
will O
have O
to O
say O
PUNCT O
this O
bengali O
fast O
food O
joint O
is O
clearly O
my O
favorite O
PUNCT O

overall O
PUNCT O
a O
solid O
restaurant O
and O
at O
less O
than O
PUNCT O
40pp O
including O
wine S-NEU
PUNCT O
a O
solid O
deal O
as O
well O
PUNCT O

since O
it O
literally O
is O
a O
complete O
hole O
in O
the O
wall O
PUNCT O
it O
's O
a O
bit O
intimidating O
at O
first O
PUNCT O
but O
you O
get O
over O
that O
very O
quickly O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
friendly O
staff S-POS
welcomes O
you O
PUNCT O
do O
n't O
hesitate O
to O
ask O
for O
help O
with O
what O
to O
get O
PUNCT O

based O
on O
the O
reviews O
for O
dinner S-POS
PUNCT O
this O
is O
a O
place O
i O
would O
reconsider O
revisiting O
for O
that O
PUNCT O
but O
definitely O
not O
for O
dim B-NEG
sum E-NEG
again O
PUNCT O

it O
costs O
PUNCT O
2 O
extra O
to O
turn O
a O
regular O
roll S-NEG
into O
an O
inside-out O
roll S-NEG
PUNCT O
but O
the O
roll S-NEG
more O
than O
triples O
in O
size O
PUNCT O
and O
that O
's O
not O
just O
from O
the O
rice S-NEU
PUNCT O

even O
with O
john O
's O
and O
joe O
's O
around O
the O
corner O
PUNCT O
this O
place O
will O
make O
a O
name O
for O
itself O
PUNCT O

it O
melted O
in O
my O
little O
mouth O
and O
the O
perfect O
consistency-not O
too O
fishy O
PUNCT O
creamy O
PUNCT O
and O
slightly O
buttery O
PUNCT O

when O

unable O

PUNCT O

PUNCT O

my O
girlfriend O
convinced O
me O
to O
go O
in O
the O
other O
night O
for O
a O
quick O
bite O
PUNCT O

the O
dim B-NEG
sum E-NEG
is O
ok O
but O
does O
n't O
taste O
that O
fresh O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
little B-NEG
dishes E-NEG
do O
n't O
look O
steamy O
hot O
as O
they O
should O
also O
note O
lack O
of O
chinese O
here O
PUNCT O

despite O
the O
untasteful O
previous O
review O
PUNCT O

do O
n't O
judge O
this O
place O
prima O

PUNCT O
you O
have O
to O
try O
it O
to O
believe O
it O
PUNCT O
a O

that O

this O

even O

the O

fresh O
PUNCT O

first O
the O
wrong O

came O
out O

PUNCT O

not O
sure O

PUNCT O
but O
saul O

in O
a O
great O

great O
food S-POS
PUNCT O

in O
an O
area O
sadly O
lacking O
in O
decent O
thai B-POS
food E-POS
PUNCT O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
spots O
PUNCT O

tell O

and O
get O
a O
free O
confused O
look O
from O
the O
waiter S-NEG
PUNCT O

make O
reservations S-NEG
but O
expect O
to O
be O
delayed O
15-20 O
minutes O
as O
the O
hosting B-NEG
staff E-NEG
was O
having O
difficulty O
seating S-NEG
guests O
who O
arrived O
with O
a O
reservation S-NEU
because O
they O
probably O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
walk O
ins O
being O
so O
close O
to O
time O
square O
PUNCT O

the O
food S-POS
was O
average O
or O
above O
including O
some O
surprising O
tasty O
dishes S-POS
PUNCT O

other O
apetizers S-NEU
and O
food S-NEU

the O
noodle B-POS
and I-POS
rices I-POS
dishes E-POS
taste O
great O
PUNCT O

the O
food S-POS
's O
as O
good O
as O
ever O
PUNCT O

the O
crust S-POS
is O
thin O
PUNCT O
the O
ingredients S-POS
are O
fresh O
and O
the O
staff S-POS
is O
friendly O
PUNCT O

your O
friends O
will O
thank O
you O
for O
introducing O
them O
to O
this O
gem O
PUNCT O

also O
a O
little O
more O
expensive O
than O
your O
average O
bagel S-NEU
place O
PUNCT O

the O
food S-NEG
was O
undercooked-the O
sauce S-NEG
watery O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
vegetables S-NEG
raw O
PUNCT O

and O
the O
fried B-POS
clams E-POS
had O
just O
enough O
kick O
to O
them O
to O
make O
em O
worth O
eating O
PUNCT O

the O
sauces S-NEG
used O
are O
also O
not O
that O
exciting O
PUNCT O

the O
secret O
is O
the O
lunch B-POS
menu E-POS
which O
offers O
a O
complimentary O
appetizer S-POS
with O
every O
entree S-POS
ordered O
PUNCT O

i O
absolutely O
love O
this O
place O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

the O
rice S-NEG
was O
poor O
quality S-NEG
and O
was O
cooked S-NEG
so O
badly O
it O
was O
hard O
PUNCT O

we O
had O
champagne S-POS
and O
caviar S-POS
and O
felt O
like O
princesses O
PUNCT O

the O
shrimp B-POS
scampi E-POS
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
antipasti S-POS
were O
plentiful O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
surprised O
to O
say O
the O
least O
and O
find O
such O
practice O
not O
worth O
the O
effort O
PUNCT O

when O
my O
dessert S-NEU
came O
PUNCT O
there O
was O
a O
candle O
in O
it O
PUNCT O
not O
because O
anyone O
asked O
for O
one O
PUNCT O
but O
because O
the O
waiter S-POS
must O
have O
seen O
me O
opening O
my O
birthday O
card O
and O
gift O
PUNCT O
and O
said O
he O
knew O
it O
was O
a O
special O
occassion O
of O
some O
sort O
PUNCT O

i O
got O
the O
PUNCT O
10 O
10-piece O
dim B-POS
sum I-POS
combo E-POS
PUNCT O
every O
bite O
of O
which O
was O
great O
PUNCT O

there O
are O
other O
vietnamese O
restaurants O
in O
the O
chinatown O
area O
and O
you O
can O
forget O
about O
those O
PUNCT O

there O
is O
also O
very O
limited O
seating S-NEG
and O
there O
can O
be O
a O
substantial O
wait S-NEG
in O
getting O
food S-NEU
at O
peak O
times O
PUNCT O

if O
it O
's O
just O
a O
quick O
martini S-NEU
at O
the O
bar S-NEU
which O
i O
recommend O
jeffery O
's O
or O
a O
mind O
blowing O
roast B-POS
chicken E-POS
PUNCT O
go O
to O
village O
PUNCT O

there O
was O
a O
long O
wait S-NEG
for O
a O
table S-NEU
outside O
PUNCT O
but O
it O
was O
a O
little O
too O
hot O
in O
the O
sun O
anyway O
so O
our O
insde O
table S-NEU
was O
very O
nice O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
definently O
recommend O
this O
restaurant O
PUNCT O

the O
prices S-POS
are O
wonderfully O
low O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
like O
spicy B-NEU
food E-NEU
get O
the O
chicken B-NEU
vindaloo E-NEU
PUNCT O

i O
love O
this O
place O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
but O
their O
true O
strength O
lays O
in O
their O
amazingly O
delicious O
and O
cheap O
lunch B-POS
specials E-POS
PUNCT O

so O
much O
more O
than O
the O
usual O
bar B-POS
food E-POS
PUNCT O
go O
there O
to O
enjoy O
the O
menu S-POS
while O
sampling O
one O
of O
their O
hand-crafted B-POS
beers E-POS
PUNCT O

and O
its O
absolutely O
delicious O
PUNCT O

no O
free O
drink S-NEU
PUNCT O

i O
would O
say O
that O
all O
was O
fine O
and O
tasty O
but O
the O
heaviness O
on O
my O
stomach O
someting O
that O
i O
ca O
n't O
not O
mention O
or O
undermine O
PUNCT O

this O

my O

definitely O

while O
they O

capex S-POS
to O
a O
minimum O
PUNCT O
they O
do O
put O
some O
cash O
into O
the O

they O
among O
the O

in O
the O

PUNCT O

the O
two O
star O
chefs S-NEU
left O
quite O
some O

was O
bland O
and O
small O
PUNCT O
dessert S-NEG
was O
not O
inspired O
PUNCT O

i O
highly O
recommend O
it O
PUNCT O

oh O
and O
it O
's O
too O
tiny O
for O
families O
with O
strollers O
PUNCT O

with O
the O
exception O
of O
our O
lemon B-NEG
salad E-NEG
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper S-NEG
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes O
started O
watering O
PUNCT O
the O
food S-NEU
here O
was O
decent O
PUNCT O
not O
great O
PUNCT O

the O

thai O
PUNCT O
lad O

and O
various O
other O

PUNCT O
i O

had O
better O
thai B-NEU
food E-NEU
in O
less O
asthetically O
pleasing O
places S-NEG
PUNCT O

delicious O
food S-POS
at O
a O
great O

but O
do O
not O
go O

on O
a O
cold O

and O
sit O
by O
the O
front B-NEU
door E-NEU
PUNCT O

overall O
PUNCT O
i O
'm O
still O
impressed O
that O
the O
place O
even O
exists O
and O
the O
prices S-POS
are O
quite O
decent O
but O
then O
again O
PUNCT O
its O
chinatown O
PUNCT O

admittedly O
some O
nights O
inside O
the O
restaurant O
were O
rather O
warm O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
open B-POS
kitchen E-POS
is O
part O
of O
the O
charm O
PUNCT O

my O
six O

loved O
it O
PUNCT O

pizza S-NEG

a O

the O

mai I-NEG

had O
no O
curry B-NEG

whatsoever O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
manager S-NEG
is O
a O
complete O
incompetent O
PUNCT O

the O
wine B-POS
list E-POS
is O
interesting O
and O

many O
good O

PUNCT O

murray O
wo O
n't O

it O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O

in O
cute O
PUNCT O
though O
a O

dank O
PUNCT O
little O
nolita O
hangout O
PUNCT O
but O
service S-NEG
terrible O
PUNCT O

most O
people O
eat O
there O
seem O
to O
be O
typical O
upper O
east O
side O
snobs O
PUNCT O
so O
be O
aware O
PUNCT O

the O
waiter S-NEG
actually O
poured O
water S-NEU
on O
my O
hand O
and O
walked O
away O
PUNCT O

the O
food S-POS
is O
mostly O
made O
from O
scratch O
PUNCT O
fresh O
and O
well O
prepared O
PUNCT O

worse O
of O
all O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
60 O

PUNCT O

PUNCT O

no O

sushi S-POS
of O
a O
very O
high O
quality S-POS
i O
even O
took O
a O
friend O
here O
from O
japan O
who O
said O
it O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
sushi S-POS
places O
in O
the O
us O
that O
he O
has O
been O
to O
PUNCT O

i O
brought O
some O
buddies O
from O
ca O
and O
they O
loved O
it O
PUNCT O

during O
our O
meal S-NEU
PUNCT O
the O
management S-POS
came O
over O
and O
checked O
on O
us O
and O
even O
bought O
us O
a O
round B-NEU
of I-NEU
drinks E-NEU
PUNCT O

but O
they O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
toaster S-NEG
PUNCT O
which O
is O
strange O
PUNCT O

so O
PUNCT O
for O
good O
food S-POS
i O
'd O
recommend O
it O
PUNCT O
but O
not O
for O
a O
fun O
night O
out O
PUNCT O

the O
menu B-NEU
choices E-NEU
are O
similar O
but O
the O
taste S-NEG
lacked O
more O
flavor S-NEG
than O
it O
looked O
PUNCT O

a O
must O
for O
all O
the O
dosa S-POS
lovers O
PUNCT O

the O
portions S-POS
are O
huge O
PUNCT O
so O
it O
might O
be O
good O
to O
order O
three O
things O
to O
split O
rather O
than O
one O
appetizer S-NEU
and O
entree S-NEU
per O
person O
for O
two O
people O
PUNCT O

the O
appetizers S-NEU
are O
just O
ok O
and O
the O
main B-NEG
courses E-NEG
were O
decidedly O
subpar O
PUNCT O

the O
exotic B-POS
food E-POS
is O
beautifully O
presented O
and O
is O
a O
delight O
in O
delicious O
combinations O
PUNCT O

the O
staff S-POS
is O
very O
attentive O
and O
we O
can O
almost O
always O
get O
a O
table S-POS
PUNCT O

if O
you O
are O
a O
vegetarian O
PUNCT O
this O
really O
is O
n't O
a O
good O
place O
to O
go O
PUNCT O

try O
the O
mediterranean B-POS
salad E-POS
PUNCT O
it O
is O
a O
true O
experience O
for O
your O
taste O
buds O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
sure O
i O
'll O
return O
for O
a O
final O
judgement O
tho O
PUNCT O

of O
course O
PUNCT O
it O
is O
crowded O
but O
who O
cares O
PUNCT O

this O
quaint O
and O
romantic O
trattoria O
is O
at O
the O
top O
of O
my O
manhattan O

PUNCT O

the O
cream B-POS

out O

i O
love O
that O
coffee S-POS
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

from O
the O
entrees S-POS
to O
the O
sides S-POS
to O
the O

PUNCT O
everything O
was O
creatively O

yet O
still O
simple O
PUNCT O

hmmm O
PUNCT O

service S-POS
was O
prompt O
and O
courteous O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
not O
above O
ordinary O
and O
the O
beef B-NEG
version E-NEG
had O
cheap O
undercooked O
beef S-NEG
PUNCT O

chance O
is O
a O
small O
cozy O
restaurant O
PUNCT O
with O
a O
romantic O
feel O
to O
it O
PUNCT O
the O
decor S-POS
is O
great O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
nice O

PUNCT O

i O
ca O
n't O
give O
it O
high O

PUNCT O

overall O
PUNCT O
worht O

PUNCT O

when O

PUNCT O

only O

PUNCT O
but O
the O
house B-POS
varities E-POS

good O
PUNCT O

this O

must O
have O
cost S-NEG
the O
owners S-NEU
afortune O
to O
build O
PUNCT O

my O
mouth O
starts O
to O
water O
merely O
thinking O
about O
the O
delight O
that O
is O
this O
restaurant O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
n't O
been O
to O
the O

PUNCT O

oh O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
complimentary O

just O
enough O
yummy O
PUNCT O

people O
dress O

PUNCT O

we O

the O

PUNCT O

knowledge O

PUNCT O

we O
were O
walking O

went O
into O
this O

just O
for O
some O
drinks S-NEU
PUNCT O

decent O
wine B-POS
selection E-POS
too O
PUNCT O

go O
with O
a O
group O
of O
friends O
and O
you O
will O
have O
a O
great O
time O
PUNCT O

it O
saves O
walking O
in O

waiting S-NEG
for O
a O
table S-NEG
in O
the O
often O
noisy O
PUNCT O
crowded O
bar S-NEG
at O

PUNCT O

i O
have O
to O
say O
i O
have O
never O
had O
a O
disapointing O
meal S-POS
here O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
one O
of O
our O
favorite O
places O
to O
eat O
in O
ny O
PUNCT O

the O
place O
does O
get O
crowded O
PUNCT O
so O
i O
recommend O
going O
between O
4-5 O
pm O
PUNCT O

mine O
was O
a O
little O
burnt O
but O
still O
delicious O
with O
goat B-POS

PUNCT O
lousy O

PUNCT O

i O
'm O
from O

PUNCT O
this O

the O

i O
recommend O
going O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
want O
a O
casual O
neighborhood O
bistro O
that O
has O
great O
food S-POS
and O
excellent O
service S-POS
PUNCT O
this O
is O
the O
place O
PUNCT O

great O
place O
to O
go O
for O
a O
drink S-NEU
too O
because O
they O
have O
100 O
kinds B-POS
of I-POS
beer E-POS
PUNCT O

but O
this O
place O
is O
a O
well-oiled O
machine O
so O
they O
know O
what O
they O
're O
doing O
PUNCT O

over O
price S-NEG
PUNCT O
and O
small O
portions S-NEG
PUNCT O

meanwhile O
PUNCT O
the O
bartender S-POS
continued O
to O
pour O
champagne S-NEU
from O
his O
reserve O
after O
we O
had O
finished O
our O

we O
enjoyed O
an O
amuse O
of O
turnip B-POS
soup I-POS

pureed I-POS

PUNCT O
gratis O
PUNCT O

but O
i O

on O
the O
second O

he O
reached O

PUNCT O

the O
food S-POS
was O
well O
prepared O
and O
the O

impecable O
PUNCT O

their O
best O

is O
thh O
thai B-POS
spiced I-POS

noodles I-POS
with I-POS

PUNCT O
a O
dish S-POS
that O
would O

it O

here O
PUNCT O

my O
husband O
said O
the O
portions S-NEG
were O
very O
small O
PUNCT O

if O
my O

course E-NEG
was O
good O
to O

the O
portion S-POS
would O
've O
been O
fine O
for O

i O
've O

everything O

all O

the O

fresh O

hinting O
that O
we O

we O
just O
sat O
down O
PUNCT O

sometimes O

ok O
service S-NEU
PUNCT O

we O
just O
ate O
at O
kai O
and O
were O
disapointed O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
a O
place O
for O
people O
who O
pay O
a O
lot O
for O
mediocre O

PUNCT O
noise S-NEG
and O
a O
chance O
to O
be O
with O
their O
fellow O
bridge O

folks O
PUNCT O

this O
was O
a O
great O
surprise O
PUNCT O

after O
complaining O
about O
the O
chicken B-NEG
dish E-NEG
PUNCT O
the O
manager S-NEG
came O
over O
to O
tell O
us O
that O
PUNCT O
no O

complained O
before O
PUNCT O
and O
that O
we O
just O
did O

know O
what O
the O

was O
supposed O
to O
taste O
like O
PUNCT O

the O
food S-POS
was O
spicy O

delicious O
PUNCT O

i O
went O
with O
my O
fiance O
on O
a O
tuesday O
evening O
PUNCT O

a O
little O
overpriced O

worth O
it O
once O

hype O
PUNCT O

bartender S-NEG
was O
unable O
to O
tear O
himself O
away O
from O
friends O
at O

PUNCT O

anyways O
PUNCT O
if O
you O
're O
in O

to O
eat O
good O
food S-POS
PUNCT O
i O
would O
n't O
waste O

rather O
go O
across O

to O

dahkin O
also O
offers O
prix B-POS

although O
the O

could O
be O
a O
little O
more O
eye O
catching O
and O
roomier O
PUNCT O
at O
the O
same O
time O
PUNCT O
it O
does O
n't O
really O
matter O
PUNCT O

you O
can O
barely O
see O
who O
you O

PUNCT O

this O
was O
my O
frist O

i O
must O
say O
how O
delicous O
the O

was O
PUNCT O

i O
do O

on O
a O
double O

his O

PUNCT O

place O
to O
grab O
a O
hot B-POS

on O

PUNCT O
poured O
oil S-NEU
and O
sprinkled O
pepper B-NEU
powder E-NEU
over O
it O
the O

translucent O

red O
PUNCT O

one O
would O
think O
we O
'd O
get O
an O
apology O
or O
complimentary O
drinks S-NEU
PUNCT O
instead O
PUNCT O
we O
got O
a O
snobby O
waiter S-NEG
would O
n't O
even O
take O
our O
order O
for O
15 O
minutes O
and O
gave O
us O
lip O
when O
we O
asked O
him O
to O
do O
so O
PUNCT O

one O
of O
my O
favorite O
places O
in O
manhattan O
PUNCT O

we O
actually O
gave O
10 O
PUNCT O
tip S-NEG
which O
we O
have O
never O
done O
despite O
mediocre O
food S-NEU
and O
service S-NEU
PUNCT O
because O
we O
felt O
totally O
ripped O
off O

we O
were O
looking O
forward O
to O
nice O
glass B-POS
of I-POS
sangria E-POS
when O

highly O
disappointed O
by O
the O
poor O
service B-NEG
waiter E-NEG
was O
not O
quite O
competent O

slow O
service S-NEG
and O
lack O
of O
remorse O
PUNCT O

i O
for O
one O
will O
never O

again O
PUNCT O

i O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
great O

PUNCT O

a O

PUNCT O

the O
food S-POS

delicious O
and O
the O
waiter S-POS
was O
incredibly O
helpful O
and O
attentive O
considering O
we O
were O
the O
only O
ones O
there O
for O
the O
first O
hour O
PUNCT O

from O
the O
spectacular O
caviar S-POS

i O
will O
be O
going O
back O
and O
heartily O
recommend O
it O
PUNCT O

would O
definitely O
visit O
again O
PUNCT O

definitely O
worth O
the O
trip O
to O
battery O
park O
city O
PUNCT O

perhaps O
this O
food O
is O
considered O
extreme O
to O
an O
upper O
east O
side O
resident O
PUNCT O
but O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
who O
've O
actually O
eaten O
ethnic B-NEG
food E-NEG
PUNCT O
this O
is O
simply O
dull O
PUNCT O

the O
place S-NEG
was O
real O
empty O
but O
that O
was O
because O
this O
was O
the O
first O
sunday O
they O
ever O
opened O
PUNCT O

this O
little O
place O
definitely O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O

PUNCT O
it O

PUNCT O
PUNCT O

tasty O
but O
expensive O
PUNCT O

you O
get O
the O
sense O
that O
the O
people S-POS
there O
care O
about O
their O
restaurant O
and O
about O
your O
experience O
and O
that O
is O
very O
nice O
PUNCT O

both O
are O
delicious O
PUNCT O
the O
cooks S-POS
are O

and O
are O
willing O
to O
take O
a O
moment O
and O
speak O
to O
you O
and O

was O
disappointed O
with O
the O

i O
thought O
the O

on O
the O
pricey O
side O
PUNCT O

we O
had O
a O
most O
unpleasant O
experience O
at O
this O

PUNCT O

the O
spicy B-POS

the O

most O
of O

were O
dumplings S-NEU

PUNCT O

maybe O
i O

so O
because O
it O
looked O
promising O

turns O
out O

poorly O

awful O
PUNCT O

after O
my O

time O
the O

remembered O
me O

treated O

this O

some O
beef S-NEG

noodle B-NEG
soup I-NEG
dishes E-NEG
from O
the O
thai O
section O
of O
the O
menu S-NEG

nothing O
we O
got O
was O
thai O
PUNCT O

they O
have O
a O
huge O
selection O
of O
different O
cream B-POS

and O
all O
of O
their O
salads S-POS
are O
great O
PUNCT O

the O
lobster B-POS
sandwich E-POS
is O
good O
and O
the O
spaghetti B-POS
with I-POS

is O
great O
PUNCT O

the O
food S-POS
was O
authentic O
PUNCT O

the O
dim B-POS

is O
delectable O
while O
the O
prices S-POS
are O
quite O
easy O
on O
the O
wallet O
PUNCT O

i O
only O
tried O
a O
simple O
dish S-POS
of O
spinach B-POS
ravioli I-POS
in I-POS
a I-POS
light I-POS
oil I-POS
and I-POS
garlic I-POS
sauce E-POS
PUNCT O
but O
it O
actually O
faired O
better O
than O
most O
nyc O
italian O

i O
've O
tried O
similar O
dish S-POS
at O
PUNCT O

the O
worst O
excuse O
for O
japanese B-NEG

i O
've O
ever O
encountered O
PUNCT O

a O
million O
better O
places O
to O
go O
in O
the O
city O
PUNCT O

if O
celebrities O
make O
you O
sweat O
PUNCT O
then O
your O
in O
for O
a O
ride O
PUNCT O
but O
if O
your O
like O
most O
around O
these O
parts O
then O
you O
'll O
just O
yawn O
and O
wonder O
whats O
with O
all O
the O
hype O
PUNCT O

okay-i O
do O
n't O
mind O
the O
oily O
part O
cause O
most O
are O
cooked O
that O
way O
but O
it O
was O
way O
too O
bland O
PUNCT O

i O
ordered O
a O
chicken B-NEG
teriyaki I-NEG
dish E-NEG
and O
found O
that O
the O
chicken S-NEG
was O
extremely O
dry O
PUNCT O

i O
love O
it O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
want O
something O
really O
different O
than O
try O
jekyll O
and O
hyde O
PUNCT O

we O
had O
reservations S-NEG
at O
9pm O
PUNCT O
but O
was O
not O
seated O
until O
10 O
PUNCT O
15pm O
PUNCT O

we O
had O
pam's B-POS
special I-POS
fried I-POS
fish E-POS
and O
it O
was O
amazing O
PUNCT O

its O
located O
in O
greenewich O
village O
PUNCT O

three O
strikes O
and O
this O
restaurant O
is O
out O
PUNCT O

we O
bring O
in O
a O
party O
of O
ten O
or O
so O
every O
week O
PUNCT O

my O
boyfriend O
had O
the O
new B-POS
england I-POS
chowder E-POS
it O
was O
good O
but O
i O
think O
the O
award O
should O
go O
to O
the O
lobster B-POS
bisque E-POS
PUNCT O

so O
PUNCT O
a O
little O
inconsistency O
there O
but O
either O
way O
PUNCT O
both O
pizzas S-POS
were O
really O
good O
PUNCT O

overall O
the O
restaurant O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
our O
other O
sushi S-NEU
favorites O
PUNCT O
but O
everything O
was O
delicious O
PUNCT O

we O
would O
return O
to O
this O
place O
again O
PUNCT O

not O
enough O
wines B-NEG
by I-NEG
the I-NEG
glass E-NEG
either O
PUNCT O

i O
had O
the O
duck B-POS
breast I-POS
special E-POS
on O
my O
last O
visit O
and O
it O
was O
incredible O
PUNCT O

i O
must O
say O
it O
's O
a O
little O
pricey O
for O
the O
food S-NEG
because O
it O
was O
not O
as O
spectacular O
as O
the O
view O
PUNCT O

these O
innovators O
of O
french B-POS
indian I-POS
fusion E-POS
do O
a O
great O
job O
of O
making O
dishes S-POS
as O
interesting O
as O
possible O
while O
still O
being O
accessible O
PUNCT O

just O
do O
n't O
take O
the O
seat S-NEG
between O
the O
bar S-NEU
and O
the O
back O
half O
of O
the O
restaurant O
PUNCT O
i O
saw O
a O
woman O
get O
nudged O
40times O
sitting O
there O
PUNCT O

no O
gimmicks O
here O
PUNCT O
the O
food S-POS
speaks O
for O
itself O
in O
its O
freshness O
and O
preparation O
PUNCT O

we O
were O
worried O
we O
would O
have O
trouble O
getting O
in O
PUNCT O
but O
somehow O
managed O
to O
have O
a O
short O
wait S-POS
PUNCT O

my O
wife O
had O
the O
fried B-POS
shrimp E-POS
which O
are O
huge O
and O
loved O
it O
PUNCT O

everything O
i O
had O
was O
good O
PUNCT O
and O
i O
'm O
a O
eater O
PUNCT O

one O
should O
not O
go O
to O
lucky O
strike O
for O
the O
food S-NEG
PUNCT O

the O
service S-NEG
is O
awful O
-- O
the O
last O
time O
i O
was O
there O
and O
i O
do O
mean O
the O
last O
time O
we O
were O
told O
that O
they O
needed O
our O
table S-NEG
so O
we O
would O
have O
to O
leave O
PUNCT O

we O
could O
only O
get O
through O
an O
appetizer S-NEU
and O
cheese B-NEU
fondue E-NEU
PUNCT O

try O
everything O
for O
that O
matter O
PUNCT O
it O
is O
all O
good O
PUNCT O

both O
times O
we O
waited O
well O
over O
a O
half O

even O
though O
we O
had O
reservations S-NEG
PUNCT O

PUNCT O
we O
had O
to O

PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

had O
the O

they O
were O
delicious O
and O
the O
sauce S-POS
was O
wonderful O
PUNCT O

we O
were O
also O
seated O
promptly O
at O
the O
time O
of O
our O
reservation S-POS
and O
the O
service S-POS
was O
very O
quick O
and O
professional O
PUNCT O

you O
rarely O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
a O

and O
the O
currys B-POS
(masaman, I-POS
green, I-POS

full O
of O
flavor S-POS
and O
come O
super O

PUNCT O
and O
the O
house B-POS
champagne E-POS
is O
a O
great O
value O
PUNCT O

at O

competing O
for O
that O
same O
luxury O
PUNCT O
the O

the O

the O

PUNCT O
this O

even O
on O
a O

like O
that O
of O
when O

also O

the O

well O
PUNCT O
it O

PUNCT O
some O

a O

PUNCT O
i O
thought O
it O
was O
just O
annoying O
PUNCT O

the O
service S-NEG
was O
a O
bit O
slow O
PUNCT O
but O
they O
were O
very O
friendly O
PUNCT O

however O
PUNCT O
i O
do O
not O

the O

PUNCT O

it O

a O

the O

PUNCT O

food O
does O

appear O

there O

a O
high O

its O
pretty O
fresh O
PUNCT O

nice O

though O
PUNCT O

similar O
to O
other O
indian O

PUNCT O
they O
use O
the O
dinner B-NEU
special E-NEU
to O
attract O
customers O
at O
the O

PUNCT O

it O
is O
a O
small O
restuarant O

go O
early O
and O
it O
will O
be O
nice O
and O
quiet O
go O
late O
and O
it O
will O
be O
packed O
PUNCT O

the O
people O
with O

of O
food S-POS
do O

understand O
you O
because O
they O
do O

speak O

PUNCT O
their O
job O
is O
to O
give O
you O
the O
delicious O
food S-POS
you O
point O
at O
PUNCT O

the O
crackling B-POS
calamari I-POS
salad E-POS
PUNCT O
which O
is O
usually O
a O
cheap O
disaster O
at O
many O

PUNCT O
is O
crispy O

lightly O

PUNCT O

not O
the O

PUNCT O
but O
excellent O
for O
a O
PUNCT O
1995 O
all O

shockingly O

the O

PUNCT O

we O
've O
never O

but O
maybe O
we O
've O
been O
lucky O
PUNCT O

drinks S-NEG
way O
over O
priced S-NEG
PUNCT O

the O
main O
downside O
to O
the O

is O
the O
nazi-like O
guy S-NEG
running O
it O
who O
constantly O
complains O
about O
the O
noise B-NEG

PUNCT O

what O
i O
did O

like O
was O
how O
the O

PUNCT O

we O
had O
a O
great O
time O
at O
the O
jekyll O

last O
night O
PUNCT O

try O
it O
side O
by O
side O
and O
there O
's O
no O
comparison O
PUNCT O

i O
think O
i O
've O
had O
some O
the O
best O
meals S-POS
of O
my O
life O
at O
minnow O
PUNCT O

my O
biggest O
complaint O
was O
the O
un-tasty O
food O
although O
presented O
well O
PUNCT O

this O
tiny O
restaurant O
is O
as O
cozy O
as O
it O
gets O
PUNCT O
with O
that O
certain O
parisian O
flair O
PUNCT O

so O
sorry O
i O
ca O
n't O
rate O
this O
better O
PUNCT O

most O
importantly O
PUNCT O
food S-POS
is O
excellent O
PUNCT O

great O
roofdeck S-POS
PUNCT O
nice O
group O
of O
30 O
somethings O
PUNCT O
but O
no O
music S-NEG
PUNCT O
kind O
of O
quiet O
PUNCT O

if O
we O
were O
to O
move O
from O
the O
upper O
east O
side O
PUNCT O
we O
would O
genuinely O
miss O
this O
restaurant O
PUNCT O

the O
best O
part O
of O
the O
experience O
was O
knowing O
that O
the O
manager S-POS
a O
bubbly O
PUNCT O
friendly O
young O
woman O
with O
a O
great O
smile O
truly O
cared O
about O
how O
we O
were O
doing O
PUNCT O

ok O
PUNCT O
for O
all O
of O
us O
growing O
up O
in O

PUNCT O
we O

spoiled O
by O
a O
plethora O
of O

PUNCT O
most O
of O
which O
stay O
open O
very O
late O
PUNCT O

however O
PUNCT O
service S-NEU

i O
had O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
highly O

it O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
great O
to O
go O
for O
a O
quick O
lunch S-POS
either O
alone O
or O
with O
a O
friend O
PUNCT O

the O
food S-NEU
was O
mediocre O
at O

but O
it O
was O
the O
horrible O
service S-NEG
that O
made O
me O
vow O
never O
to O
go O
back O
PUNCT O

lloovve O
this O
place O
PUNCT O

so O
some O
of O
the O
reviews O
here O
are O
accurate O
about O
the O
crowd S-NEG
and O
noise S-NEG
PUNCT O

you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O

and O
with O
that O
logic O
in O

PUNCT O
spice O

a O
great O
place O
to O
grab O
some O
cheap O
eats S-POS
and O

in O
a O
beautiful O

PUNCT O

place O

authentic O
PUNCT O

the O
service S-NEG
was O
terrible O
PUNCT O
we O

being O
a O
little O
crowded O

a O

overpriced O
PUNCT O
the O

the O

a O

the O

PUNCT O
thin-crust B-POS

that O
i O

never O

PUNCT O

the O
only O

this O

going O

try O
the O

again O
PUNCT O
not O
the O

worth O

the O
lamb B-POS
vindaloo E-POS
is O

however O
PUNCT O
go O

and O
consider O
the O

just O
a O
companion O
for O
a O

PUNCT O

i O
think O
this O

for O
out-of-towners O

obviously O
the O

at O

just O
bring O

recently O
tried O

i O
thought O
that O
it O
was O
great O
PUNCT O

a O
little O
noise O
but O
i O
think O
that O
was O
because O
of O
our O
party O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
run O
by O
the O
same O
sichuan B-NEU
chef E-NEU
who O
started O
the O

PUNCT O

if O
the O

PUNCT O

i O
ca O
n't O
wait O

if O

PUNCT O

it O
can O
not O

warn O
the O

the O

so O
if O

a O

PUNCT O

they O
were O
very O
abrupt O
with O

when O
i O

actually O
claimed O
the O
food S-NEG
was O
late O
because O
they O
were O
out O

PUNCT O

after O
we O
got O
our O

PUNCT O
i O
could O
not O
believe O
how O

PUNCT O

after O
the O

we O

service S-POS
is O
extraordinary O
PUNCT O

into O

PUNCT O

the O
dosas S-NEG
are O
skimpy O
PUNCT O
unattractive O

the O

your O

we O
all O

PUNCT O

it O
only O
took O
about O
five O

the O

overpowering O
and O
not O
very O
tasty O
PUNCT O

my O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
you O
are O
literally O
sitting O
on O

of O
the O

next O
to O
you O
PUNCT O

and O
affordable O

i O
not O
recommend O
jimmy O

PUNCT O
i O
would O
strongly O
suggest O
they O
go O
anywhere O
but O
PUNCT O

they O

a O
very O
diverse O
menu S-POS
so O
its O
something O
for O
everybody O
PUNCT O

haru O
on O

simply O
disgusting O
PUNCT O

the O
staff S-NEG

too O
busy O

spot E-POS
in O
the O

PUNCT O

i O

huge O
PUNCT O

PUNCT O

i O
like O
the O
somosas S-POS
PUNCT O
chai S-POS
PUNCT O
and O
the O
chole S-POS
PUNCT O
but O
the O
dhosas S-NEG
and O
dhal S-NEG
were O
kinda O
dissapointing O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
a O
very O
nice O
surprise O
PUNCT O

edible O
but O
really O
a O
ripoff O
at O
those O
prices S-NEG
given O
whats O
in O
the O
area O
PUNCT O

the O
staff O
has O
been O
nice O
PUNCT O
but O
they O
seemed O
really O
stressed O
and O
the O
unisex O
bathroom S-NEG
needs O
to O
be O
cleaned O
more O
often O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
french O
and O
i O
really O
felt O
like O
home O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

the O

the O
only O
thing O
good O

a O
slightly O
larger O

PUNCT O
they O
left O
us O
awkardly O
seated O
PUNCT O

the O

be O
slow O
PUNCT O

there O

PUNCT O

save O

PUNCT O
they O
have O
amazing O
food S-POS
and O
the O
best O
service S-POS
PUNCT O

the O
service S-POS
was O
attentive O
without O
being O
overbearing O
and O
each O
dish S-POS
we O
tried O
was O
wonderful O
from O
the O
spring B-POS
rolls E-POS
to O
the O
cod B-POS
with I-POS
pineapple I-POS
tempura E-POS
PUNCT O

but O
trust O
me O
it O
is O
so O
worth O
it O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
not O
a O
place O
for O
tourists O
or O
someone O
who O
has O
never O
dined O
in O

ridge O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
weird O
thing O
was O
if O
we O
got O
a O
bottle S-NEU
PUNCT O
the O
waitress S-NEG
would O
have O
simply O
multiplied O
the O

no O

whatsoever O
PUNCT O

they O
sell O
special O

PUNCT O

they O
never O

PUNCT O

the O

feel O
a O
little O
crowded O
PUNCT O

the O

if O

PUNCT O
good O

so O
special O
PUNCT O

good O
food S-POS
at O

a O

i O
highly O

delicious O
top O

and O
fantastic O
service S-POS
PUNCT O

you O
ca O
n't O
say O
its O
cheap O
because O

cheaper O
in O

i O
have O
eaten O

the O

that O

PUNCT O

great O

PUNCT O

this O
is O
a O
true O
gem O
of O
the O
village O
PUNCT O

its O
location S-POS
is O
good O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
hutner O
college O
is O
near O
and O
their O
prices S-POS
are O
very O
reasonable O
PUNCT O
makes O
students O
go O
back O
to O
suan O
again O
and O
again O
PUNCT O

however O
PUNCT O
i O
think O
jeckll O
and O
hydes O
t O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
is O
fun O
to O
do O
once O
PUNCT O

they O
treat O
me O
like O
family O
PUNCT O
morning O
and O
night O
PUNCT O

a O
wonderful O

PUNCT O

my O
advice O

this O

not O
wonderful O
PUNCT O

for O

went O
to O
amma O

a O

it O
PUNCT O

kind O
of O
a O
small O
place S-NEG
but O
i O
guess O
if O
they O
are O
not O
too O
busy O
might O
be O
able O
to O
fit O
a O
group O
or O
kids O
PUNCT O

maybe O
tomorrow O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

we O
also O
ordered O
two O
hot B-NEU

thinking O
they O
would O
be O
pretty O
good O
since O
there O

a O
whole O

devoted O

which O
you O
can O
couteract O
with O
eat O
more O

the O

all O
over O
the O

PUNCT O
i O

seemed O
like O

PUNCT O

ahhh O
PUNCT O

better O
than O
the O

not O
worth O
going O
out O

in O
my O
opinion O
PUNCT O

the O
service S-NEU
was O
typical O
short-order O

PUNCT O

we O
shared O
a O

the O

extensive O
PUNCT O
though O
the O
staff S-NEG
did O
not O

about O

PUNCT O

the O
bread S-NEG
we O
received O
was O
horrible O
PUNCT O
rock O
hard O

cold O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
free O
appetizer B-NEG
of I-NEG

PUNCT O

however O
PUNCT O
our O
main B-POS

PUNCT O

i O
had O

my O

the O

PUNCT O
the O

when O

the O

PUNCT O

not O
what O
i O
would O
expect O
for O
the O

of O
this O

PUNCT O

all O
in O
all O
PUNCT O
i O
would O
return O
PUNCT O
as O
it O
was O
a O
beautiful O
restaurant S-POS
PUNCT O
but O
i O
hope O
the O
staff S-NEG
pays O
more O
attention O
to O
the O
little O
details O
in O
the O
future O
PUNCT O

short O

i O
've O

finally O
got O
a O
table O
PUNCT O

the O
menu S-POS
looked O
great O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
waiter S-POS
was O
very O
nice O
PUNCT O
but O
when O
the O
food S-NEU
came O
PUNCT O
it O
was O
average O
PUNCT O

nevertheless O
PUNCT O
i O
finished O
my O
plate O
PUNCT O
and O
that O
's O
when O
i O
found O
a O
maggot O
in O

at O
the O
bottom O
PUNCT O

i O
showed O
it O
to O
the O
manager S-POS
PUNCT O
and O
he O
smilingly O
apologized O
and O
brought O
us O
two O
free O
desserts O
but O
did O
not O
ask O
us O
what O
we O
wanted O
and O
so O
brought O
the O
last O
two O
desserts O
we O
would O
have O
asked O
for O
PUNCT O

when O
the O
bill O
came O
PUNCT O
nothing O
was O
comped O
PUNCT O
so O
i O
told O
the O
manager O
very O
politely O
that O
we O
were O
willing O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
wine O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
did O
n't O
think O
i O
should O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
food O
with O
a O
maggot O
in O
it O
PUNCT O

yes O
PUNCT O
i O
ate O
the O
food O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
certainly O
would O
not O
have O
if O
i O
had O
seen O
the O
maggot O
before O
eating O
PUNCT O
and O
i O
was O
at O
this O
point O
fairly O
sick O
to O
my O
stomach O
PUNCT O

the O
manager S-NEG
finally O
said O
he O
would O
comp O
the O
two O
glasses O
of O
wine O
which O
cost O
less O
than O
the O
food O
PUNCT O
and O
made O
it O
seem O
like O
a O
big O
concession O
PUNCT O

we O
paid O
and O
left O
because O
we O
did O
n't O
feel O

arguing O
any O
more O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
worked O
in O

a O

PUNCT O
the O

were O
really O
good O
PUNCT O

ca O
n't O
argue O
about O
that O
PUNCT O

they O

clearly O
over O

PUNCT O

what O
you O
are O
paying O

is O
the O
environment S-NEU
and O
the O
name O
PUNCT O

yes O
PUNCT O
the O
place S-POS
is O
classy O
and O
beautiful O
PUNCT O

they O
most O
certainly O
target O
the O

just O

at O

PUNCT O

i O
read O
reviews O
that O
called O
the O

too O
expensive O
and O
i O
thought O
to O
myself O
PUNCT O
but O
may O
be O
it O
is O
worth O

PUNCT O

the B-NEU
four I-NEU
seasons E-NEU
has O
history O
and O
it O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
landmark O
of O
new O
york O
city O
restaurants O
PUNCT O
but O
trust O
me O
PUNCT O
they O
will O
charge O
you O
through O
the O
nose O
just O
so O
that O
you O
can O
say O
i O
've O
been O
to O
the O
four O
seasons O
restaurant O
PUNCT O

i O
wanted O
to O
go O
there O
to O
see O
if O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
and O
sadly O
PUNCT O
curiousity O
got O
the O
best O
of O
me O
and O
i O
paid O
dearly O
for O
it O
PUNCT O

all O
in O
all O
PUNCT O
the O
food S-POS
was O
great O
except O
for O
the O
dessserts S-NEG
PUNCT O

the O
environment S-NEU
is O
very O
upscale O
and O
you O
will O
see O
a O
lot O
of O
rich O
guys O
with O
trophy O
wives O
or O
just O
highly O
paid O
escorts O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
are O
going O
for O
the O
food S-NEG
PUNCT O
it O
will O
not O
be O
worth O
it O
PUNCT O

yes O
PUNCT O
it O
is O
good O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
've O
had O
better O
for O
cheaper O
PUNCT O

you O
would O
think O
they O
would O
make O
up O
for O
it O
with O
service S-NEG
PUNCT O
sadly O
PUNCT O
no O
PUNCT O

service S-NEG
was O
just O
ok O
PUNCT O
it O
is O
not O
what O
you O
'd O
expect O
for O
PUNCT O
500 O
PUNCT O

terrible O
waste O
of O
money O
scammers O
PUNCT O

i O
agree O
that O
dining O
at O
casa B-NEG
la I-NEG
femme E-NEG
is O
like O
no O
other O
dining O
experience O
PUNCT O

but O
not O
in O
a O
good O
way O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
actually O
offended O
to O
have O
spent O
so O
much O
money O
on O
such O
a O
bad O
experience O
PUNCT O

we O
went O
to O
celebrate O
two O
birthdays O
and O
wanted O
to O
do O
something O
special O
and O
different O
PUNCT O

our O
visit O
their O
to O
say O
the O
least O
PUNCT O
was O
an O
unpleasant O
and O
costly O
experience O
PUNCT O

and O
even O
more O
so O
unpleasant O
because O
it O
was O
so O
costly O
for O
such O
an O
unpleasant O
experience O
PUNCT O

although O
we O
were O
told O
10-15 O
minutes O
and O
it O
was O
more O
like O
45 O
minutes O
PUNCT O

we O
were O
ushered O
to O
the O
bar O
to O
wait O
momentarily O
and O
upon O
arrival O
were O
so O
excited O
PUNCT O

the O
place S-POS
is O
beautiful O
PUNCT O

however O
PUNCT O
our O
PUNCT O
14 O
drinks S-NEG
were O
were O
horrible O
PUNCT O

once O
we O
finally O
got O
a O
table O
PUNCT O
despite O
indicating O
we O
wanted O
an O
alla O
carte O
menu O
we O
were O
pushed O
into O
a O
table O
that O
was O
only O
price O
fixed O
PUNCT O

since O
we O
were O
already O
waiting O
so O
long O
PUNCT O
we O
felt O
we O
had O
no O
other O
choice O
but O
to O
accept O
it O
PUNCT O

our O
experience O
did O
not O
ever O
get O
any O
better O
PUNCT O

for O
each O
course O
we O
waited O
over O
1/2 O
hour O
to O
45 O
minutes O
and O
were O
never O
offered O
a O
drink O
PUNCT O

we O
also O
asked O
for O
hooka O
six O
times O
and O
the O
waiter S-NEG
kept O
telling O
us O
one O
minute O
and O
never O
returning O
with O
the O
hooka O
PUNCT O

after O
the O
4th O
time O
i O
asked O
again O
and O
the O
waiter S-NEG
than O
said O
after O
our O
dinner O
PUNCT O

we O
asked O
for O
beverages O
and O
never O
received O
them O
PUNCT O

we O
asked O
for O
sides O
which O
the O
waiter S-NEG
than O
admitted O
that O
he O
forgot O
to O
put O
in O
that O
part O
of O
our O
order O
PUNCT O

my O
chicken S-NEG
was O
inedible O
as O
there O
were O
so O
many O
fatty O
lumps O
which O
i O
had O
to O
keep O
spitting O
out O
into O
my O
napkin O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
not O
expect O
this O
for O
a O
PUNCT O
55 O
dinner S-NEG
PUNCT O

by O
the O
time O
we O
finished O
our O
dinner O
we O
still O
had O
not O
received O
one O
beverage O
nor O
hooka O
PUNCT O

what O
we O
did O
do O
was O
waste O
3 O
hours O
being O
trapped O
in O
a O
table O
waiting O
and O
waiting O
for O
food O
and O
drinks O
and O
hooka O
some O
of O
which O
we O
never O
received O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
beverage O
we O
did O
receive O
was O
water O
in O
dirty O
glasses O
PUNCT O

to O
top O
it O
all O
off O
the O
main O
reason O
we O
came O
to O
your O
restaurant O
was O
for O
the O
belly O
dancers O
and O
missed O
the O
first O
show O
as O
we O
were O
not O
seated O
yet O
and O
the O
2nd O
belly O
dancer O
only O
danced O
at O
two O
tables O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
never O
made O
it O
around O
to O
the O
other O
half O
of O
the O
restaurant O
PUNCT O

by O
the O
time O
we O
left O
our O
wallets O
were O
empy O
and O
so O
were O
our O
stomachs O
and O
we O
missed O
the O
show O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
see O
following O
our O
dinner O
PUNCT O
which O
would O
have O
been O
acceptable O
if O
we O
got O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience O
of O
good O
food S-NEG
and O
belly O
dancers O
PUNCT O

if O
it O
seemed O
possible O
to O
do O
so O
while O
there O
i O
would O
have O
fought O
my O
bill O
since O
my O
dinner O
portion O
of O
my O
meal S-NEG
was O
inedible O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
never O
left O
a O
restaurant S-NEG
feeling O
as O
if O
i O
was O
abused O
PUNCT O
and O
wasted O
my O
hard O
earned O
money O
PUNCT O

my O
husbands O
birthday O
and O
my O
sons O
was O
not O
as O
it O
was O
intended O
and O
we O
drove O
two O
hours O
to O
spend O
too O
much O
money O
to O
be O
treated O
terribly O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

i O
wish O
i O
could O
be O
refunded O
PUNCT O

do O
n't O
go O
with O
a O
larger O
group O
than O
4 O
PUNCT O

i O
went O
here O
for O
a O
family O
birthday O
dinner O
PUNCT O

at O
first O
we O
were O
a O
little O
taken O
aback O
PUNCT O
as O
this O
seemed O
to O
present O
a O
problem O
PUNCT O
although O
the O
restaurant O
looked O
fairly O
empty O
PUNCT O
but O
they O
hastily O
put O
the O
table O
together O
for O
us O
PUNCT O

the O
menu S-NEU
is O
fairly O
simple O
without O
much O
descriptions O
PUNCT O

not O
much O
of O
a O
selection B-NEG
of I-NEG
bottled I-NEG
beer E-NEG
either O
PUNCT O
we O
went O
with O
brahma O
PUNCT O

the O
appetizers O
we O
ordered O
were O
served O
quickly O
PUNCT O
an O
order O
of O
fried B-POS
oysters I-POS
and I-POS
clams E-POS
were O
delicious O
but O
a O
tiny O
portion O
maybe O
3 O
of O
each O
PUNCT O

the O
lobster B-NEU
knuckles E-NEU
special O
of O
the O
day O
were O
ok O
PUNCT O
but O
pretty O
tasteless O
PUNCT O

i O
believe O
there O
were O
2 O
shrimp O
in O
the O
"salt B-NEG
encrusted I-NEG
shrimp" I-NEG
appetizer E-NEG
PUNCT O

after O
we O
ate O
our O
appetizers O
which O
took O
all O
of O
8 O
minutes O
we O
ordered O
another O
round O
of O
brahma O
's O
PUNCT O
and O
tried O
to O
stall O
a O
little O
as O
we O
waited O
for O
our O
sixth O
dinner O
member O
PUNCT O

the O
waitress O
appeared O
and O
asked O
us O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
order O
PUNCT O

we O
replied O
that O
we O
would O
like O
to O
wait O
5 O
more O
minutes O
if O
that O
was O
okay O
PUNCT O

she O
replied O
well O
it O
would O
be O
more O
convenient O
for O
us O
if O
you O
ordered O
now O
PUNCT O
since O
you O
are O
a O
larger O
party O
PUNCT O
and O
it O
might O
get O
crowded O
PUNCT O

we O
called O
the O
other O
person O
who O
was O
very O
close O
by O
PUNCT O
and O
she O
told O
us O
to O
order O
for O
her O
PUNCT O
so O
we O
did O
PUNCT O

i O
had O
the O
thai B-POS
style I-POS
fried I-POS
sea I-POS
bass E-POS
was O
very O
good O
PUNCT O

everyone O
seemed O
generally O
happy O
with O
their O
food S-POS
PUNCT O
except O
my O
brother O
who O
had O
the O
grilled B-NEG
mahi I-NEG
mahi E-NEG
PUNCT O
seemingly O
drenched O
in O
grapfruit O
juice O
PUNCT O

i O
heard O
the O
lobster B-POS
roll E-POS
was O
excellent O
PUNCT O

all O
in O
all O
the O
food S-POS
was O
good O
PUNCT O
a O
little O
on O
the O
expensive O
side O
PUNCT O
but O
fresh O
PUNCT O

service S-NEG
not O
the O
friendliest O
to O
our O
large O
party O
PUNCT O

probably O
would O
not O
go O
back O
here O
PUNCT O

great O
indian B-POS
food E-POS

i O
lived O
on O
50th O
st O
PUNCT O
and O
wanted O
indian O
one O
day O
so O
decided O
to O
check O
this O
place O
out O
PUNCT O

food S-POS
was O
amazing O
PUNCT O
i O
love O
indian O
food O
and O
eat O
it O
quite O
regularly O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
can O
say O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
i O
've O
had O
PUNCT O

very O
normal O
indian B-NEU
food E-NEU
PUNCT O
but O
done O
really O
well O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
it O
a O
4 O
instead O
of O
5 O
because O
of O
the O
price O
just O
chicken B-NEG
tikka I-NEG
masala E-NEG
PUNCT O
no O
bread O
of O
rice O
PUNCT O
is O
PUNCT O
25 O
PUNCT O
which O
i O
would O
expect O
at O
a O
upscale O
indian O
restaurant O
but O
this O
place S-POS
does O
n't O
have O
an O
upscale O
feel S-NEG
PUNCT O

also O
PUNCT O
waiters S-NEG
try O
to O
push O
more O
food O
on O
you O
PUNCT O
like O
suggest O
things O
as O
if O
they O
are O
complimentary O
when O
they O
actually O
cost O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
appreciate O
places O
or O
people O
that O
try O
to O
drive O
up O
the O
bill O
without O
the O
patron O
's O
knowledge O
so O
that O
was O
a O
huge O
turnoff O
more O
than O
the O
price O
PUNCT O

but O
if O
you O
're O
prepared O
to O
spend O
some O
PUNCT O
and O
remember O
to O
ask O
if O
something O
they O
offer O
is O
complimentary O
PUNCT O
then O
this O
is O
the O

PUNCT O
sometimes O
you O
have O

PUNCT O
i O
got O
through O
about O
half O
my O

found O
a O

a O

disgusting O
PUNCT O
slimy O
PUNCT O
clearly O
bad O
piece O

PUNCT O

not O
one O
to O
jump O
to O
complaints O
hence O
my O
lack O
of O
previous O

PUNCT O
i O
called O
the O
restaurant O
to O
give O
them O
a O

up O

their O

might O
want O
to O
check O
the O

PUNCT O

my O
main O
concern O
was O
the O
sanity O
of O
the O
food S-NEG
that O
was O
being O
sent O
out O
to O
myself O
and O
others O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
be O

i O
said O
that O
as O
someone O
who O
has O
worked O
in O

since O
the O
age O
of O
fifteen O
i O
was O
expecting O
at O

a O
minimal O
effort O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
restaurant O
to O
amend O
the O
situation O
PUNCT O

less O

three O

i O
found O
myself O
doubled O
over O

my O
girlfriend O
PUNCT O
being O
slightly O
more O
aggressive O
PUNCT O

out O
the O
remainder O

barely O
eaten O

PUNCT O
called O
back O
only O
to O
be O
informed O
that O
i O
was O
probably O
wrong O

that O
it O
was O
most O

an O

that O
we O

the O
service S-POS

his O

my O
wife O
and O
i O
visited O
dokebi O
tonight O
PUNCT O

we O
ordered O
dosut O
bibimbap O
and O
nakgi-bokum O
PUNCT O

the O
dishes O
came O
out O
around O
5 O
minutes O
apart O
PUNCT O

the O
bibimbap S-NEU
was O
average O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
stone B-NEG
bowl E-NEG
was O
n't O
even O
close O
to O
sizzling O
PUNCT O

too O
bad O
i O
had O
paid O
an O
extra O
PUNCT O
2 O
for O
the O
stone B-NEG
bowl E-NEG
PUNCT O

the O
nakgi-bokum S-NEG
was O
horrible O
PUNCT O

easily O
the O
worst O
stir-fried B-NEG
squid E-NEG
i O
've O
ever O
tasted O
PUNCT O

the O
sauce S-NEG
tasted O
more O
like O
chinese O
fast O
food O
than O
decent O
korean O
PUNCT O

the O
side B-NEU
dishes E-NEU
were O
passable O
PUNCT O
and O
i O
did O
get O
a O
refill O
upon O
request O
PUNCT O

the O
real O
problem O
i O
had O
with O
this O
place O
was O
the O
complete O
lack O
of O
service S-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
mentioned O
the O
squid O
dish O
was O
n't O
very O
good O
when O
the O
waitress O
visited O
PUNCT O

she O
just O
nodded O
and O
walked O
off O
PUNCT O

there O
were O
no O
communications O
issues O
either O
PUNCT O
as O
she O
spoke O
perfect O
english O
PUNCT O

my O
wife O
had O
barely O
touched O
that O
mess O
of O
a O
dish S-NEG
PUNCT O

we O
were O
charged O

PUNCT O

lives O
up O
to O
the O
hype O

we O
've O
tried O
before O
but O
it O
always O
packed O
and O
does O
n't O
take O
reservations O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
well O
worth O
the O
wait O
PUNCT O

the O
wife O
had O
the O
risotto S-POS
which O
was O
amazing O
PUNCT O

it O
does O
n't O
look O
appetizing O
as O
it O
's O
covered O
in O
squid O
ink O
and O
it O
turns O
your O
lips O
and O
teeth O
black O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
taste O
was O
phenomenal O
PUNCT O

i O
love O

love O
this O
place S-POS
PUNCT O
every O
time O
we O
are O
in O
the O
city O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
place S-POS
we O
always O
go O
PUNCT O

a O
quintessential O
slice B-NEU
of I-NEU
nyc I-NEU
pizza E-NEU
PUNCT O

the O
crust S-POS
has O
a O
great O
bite O
and O
a O
good O
chew O
PUNCT O
the O
sauce S-POS
is O
light O
with O
a O
nice O
acidity O
to O
it O
PUNCT O
the O
salt O
from O
the O
cheese S-POS
is O
great O
PUNCT O
really O
heightens O
the O
flavor O
of O
all O
the O
other O
components O
PUNCT O

personally O
i O
like O
the O
margherita B-POS
pizza E-POS
better O
PUNCT O
but O
they O
are O
all O
good O
PUNCT O

possibly O
the O
most O
romantic O
restaurant S-POS
in O
the O
city O

this O
is O
undoubtedly O
my O
favorite O
modern B-POS
japanese I-POS
brasserie E-POS
that O
do O
n't O
serve O
sushi O
PUNCT O
and O
in O
my O
opinion O
PUNCT O
one O
of O
the O
most O
romantic O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
PUNCT O

not O
only O
is O
it O
an O
adventure O
getting O
to O
this O
somewhat O
hidden O
spot S-NEU
PUNCT O
once O
you O
enter O
the O
unmarked B-POS
wooden I-POS
doors E-POS
PUNCT O
the O
zen O
and O
intimate O

will O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
're O
no O
longer O
in O
the O
city O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
're O
planning O
to O
come O
here O
PUNCT O
make O
sure O
that O
your O
date O
is O
someone O
whom O
you O
really O
like O
since O
you O
'll O
be O
ushered O
to O
private B-POS

where O
there O
will O
be O
no O

watching O
choose O
the O

on O

PUNCT O
PUNCT O

it O

just O
you O
and O
your O

before O
the O

of O
sake O
PUNCT O

i O
never O
used O

but O
am O
lately O
experimenting O
with O
it O
a O
lot O
more O
and O
am O
acquiring O
a O

taste O
of O
it O
PUNCT O

we O
started O
off O
with O
a O
delightful O
sashimi B-POS

PUNCT O

our O
first O

was O
tuna O

PUNCT O

i O
picked O
the O
grilled B-POS
black I-POS
cod E-POS
as O
my O
entree O
PUNCT O
which O
i O
absolutely O
devoured O
while O
someone O
commented O
that O
the O
grilled B-POS
salmon I-POS
dish E-POS
was O
better O
PUNCT O

the O
entrees O
were O
served O
with O
miso O
soup O
and O
rice O
PUNCT O

maybe O
it O
was O
the O
great O
company O
i O
had O
friends O
visiting O
from O

PUNCT O
yes O
PUNCT O
it O
was O
not O
a O

n't O
usually O

zenkichi S-POS
anytime O
for O
a O
quiet O
PUNCT O
unhurried O
and O
memorable O
dinner O
PUNCT O

terrible O
would O
be O
a O
compliment O
PUNCT O

the O
service S-NEG
leaves O
much O
to O

from O
feeling O

PUNCT O

we O

the O

is O
good O

this O

is O
totally O
weird O

the O
food S-NEG
they O

PUNCT O

the O
food S-POS
was O
great O

tasty O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
sitting B-NEG

was O
too O
small O
PUNCT O
i O
do O
n't O
like O
being O

i O
would O
recommend O
to O

when O

the O

the O
food S-POS
we O
ordered O
was O
excellent O
PUNCT O
although O
i O
would O

say O
the O

anything O

about O
PUNCT O

our O

was O
n't O
mean O
PUNCT O
but O
not O
especially O
warm O
or O
attentive O
either O
PUNCT O

maybe O
it O
has O
improved O
since O

PUNCT O

regardless O
PUNCT O
we O

be O

ca O
n't O

PUNCT O

dumbfoundingly O

a O
new O

alive O

right O
here O
in O

PUNCT O

the O
servers S-NEG
at O

appear O
to O
have O
perfected O
that O
ghastly O
technique O

making O
you O
feel O
guilty O

ashamed O
for O
deigning O

attract O
their O
attention O
PUNCT O

polite O
acknowledgement O
is O
out O
PUNCT O

supercilious O
scorn O

and O
how O
many O

you O
pick O
up O

PUNCT O

overall O
the O

the O

my O

our O

PUNCT O

we O
arrived O

were O
seated O
immediately O
PUNCT O
which O
made O
us O
both O
happy O
PUNCT O

we O
ordered O
our O
appetizers O
PUNCT O
i O
ordered O
the O
chicken O
and O
my O
boyfriend O
the O
salmon O
PUNCT O

everything O
was O
going O
good O
until O
we O
got O
our O
meals S-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
took O
one O
look O
at O
the O
chicken S-NEG
and O
i O
was O
appalled O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
served O
with O
skin O
PUNCT O
over O
a O
bed O
of O
extremely O
undercooked O
spinach S-NEG
and O
mashed O
potatoes O
PUNCT O

my O
boyfriend O
asked O
me O
if O
i O
wanted O
to O
switch O
and O
eat O
his O
salmon O
instead O
PUNCT O
while O
he O
de-skinned O
the O
chicken O
so O
that O
i O
could O
enjoy O
the O
white O
meat O
PUNCT O

i O
took O
one O
bite O
from O
the O
PUNCT O
24 O
salmon S-NEG
PUNCT O
and O
i O
have O
never O
PUNCT O
in O
the O
17 O
years O
i O
have O
been O
going O
to O
restaurants O
tasted O
salmon S-NEG
as O
fishy O
PUNCT O
as O
dry O
PUNCT O
and O
as O
bland O
as O
the O
one O
in O
flatbush O
farms O
PUNCT O

at O
this O
point O
PUNCT O
the O
waitress S-NEG
comes O
over O
and O
asks O
us O
if O
everything O
was O
okay O
PUNCT O
i O
was O
literally O
so O
shocked O
that O
i O
was O
speechless O
and O
did O
n't O
say O
anything O
PUNCT O
and O
guess O
what O
PUNCT O
the O
waitress S-NEG
walked O
away O
PUNCT O

so O
PUNCT O
i O
switch O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
again O
to O
see O
if O
maybe O
i O
could O
stomach O
the O
meat O
and O
spinach S-NEG
again O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
spinach S-NEG
was O
so O
undercooked O
that O
i O
just O
could O
not O
bite O
through O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
could O
n't O
even O
enjoy O
the O
mashed O
potatoes O
because O
it O
was O
hidden O
completely O
under O
the O
chicken O
and O
spinach O
PUNCT O

i O
've O
had O
better O
chicken O
at O
bbqs O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

so O
i O
decide O
to O
report O
back O
to O
the O
waitress O
because O
it O
was O
completely O
inedible O
PUNCT O

guess O
what O
PUNCT O
i O
waited O
for O
twenty O
minutes O
before O
she O
came O
over O

when O
she O
finally O
did O
PUNCT O
she O
says O
PUNCT O
oh O

PUNCT O
i O
wish O
you O
would O

said O
something O

PUNCT O
nothing O
PUNCT O

after O
that O
she O
simply O
took O
our O

PUNCT O
walked O
away O
PUNCT O
came O
back O
another O
twenty O

nothing O

PUNCT O

the O
level O
of O

the O

PUNCT O

the O
reason O
there O
are O
4 O
different O
results O
on O

for O
the O
same O
place O
is O
because O
they O
keep O

however O
PUNCT O
most O
of O

are O
at O

prompt O
and O
pleasant O
PUNCT O

this O
place S-NEG
where O
do O
i O
begin O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
quite O
a O
spectacular O
scene S-POS
i O
'll O
give O
them O
that O
PUNCT O

the O
decor S-NEU
however O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
distraction O
so O
you O
wo O

notice O
that O
you O
just O
payed O

how O
this O

the O
competitive O
west O

PUNCT O
or O
any O
other O
for O

on O
their O

PUNCT O

going O

the O

PUNCT O
and O
will O
make O
your O
tongue O
and O

very O
happy O
PUNCT O

only O
complaint O
is O
the O
pricing O
-- O
i O
believe O
it O
would O
be O
more O
reasonable O
to O
pay O
a O
dollar O
less O
on O
each O
item O
listed O
on O
the O

PUNCT O

but O
nonetheless O
-- O
great O
spot S-POS
PUNCT O
great O

PUNCT O

fabulous O
food S-POS
PUNCT O
if O
the O

do O
n't O
put O
you O
off O

we O
live O

it O

a O
little O
out O
of O
our O

on O

PUNCT O
but O
we O
've O
eaten O
there O
6 O
times O
in O
the O
last O
2 O
years O
PUNCT O

as O
bfc S-NEG
does O
n't O
take O
reservations O
you O
almost O
always O
have O
to O
wait O
by O
the O
bar O
PUNCT O
and O
be O
abused O
by O
the O
front B-NEG
of I-NEG
house I-NEG
staff E-NEG
until O
you O
are O
seated O
PUNCT O
which O
can O
be O
over O
an O
hour O
later O
PUNCT O

the O
frizzy O
retro O
girl S-NEG
with O

yell O
at O
you O
if O
you O
try O

order O
a O

PUNCT O

i O
was O
almost O
amused O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
was O
turning O
away O
customers O
at O
9pm O
on O
a O
friday O
night O
because O
she O
had O
a O
bbq O
to O
go O
to O
that O
night O
PUNCT O
wtf O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

i O
'd O
be O
horrified O
if O
my O
staff S-NEG
were O
turning O
away O
customers O
so O
early O
and O
so O
rudely O
PUNCT O

there O
's O
another O
girl S-NEG
who O
i O
ca O
n't O
describe O
PUNCT O
she O
is O
about O
5'6 O
with O
brown O
hair O
PUNCT O
who O
eavesdrops O
on O
your O
conversation O
and O
chimes O
in O
PUNCT O
except O
she O
only O
hears O
the O
last O
part O
of O
what O
you O
said O
PUNCT O
so O
her O
uninvited O
opinions O
are O
often O
out O
of O
context O
and O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
what O
you O
're O
*really* O
talking O
about O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
a O
friendly O
person O
PUNCT O
so O
i O
would O

mind O
had O
she O
not O
been O
so O
nasty O
and O
gotten O
so O
personal O
PUNCT O

again O
PUNCT O
i O
'd O
be O
super O
upset O
if O
that O
were O
my O
employee O
PUNCT O

considering O
you O
will O
spend O
at O

PUNCT O
60 O
a O

PUNCT O
i O
expect O
better O
service S-NEG
PUNCT O

my O
family O
ate O
here O
last O
weekend O
PUNCT O

this O
guy O
refused O
to O
seat O

she O
left O
PUNCT O
followed O
shortly O
by O
the O
four O
of O
us O
PUNCT O
but O
not O
before O
i O
told O
him O
that O
in O
my O
40 O
years O
of O
world O
travel O
PUNCT O
including O
paris O
PUNCT O
that O
i O
had O
never O
seen O
such O
a O
display O
of O
bad O
behavior O
by O
a O
frontman S-NEG
in O
a O

PUNCT O

his O
response O
was O
smug O
PUNCT O
arrogant O
PUNCT O

condescending O
PUNCT O
totally O
consistent O
with O
his O

on O

all O

a O
great O

PUNCT O

the O
food S-POS

the O

even O
better O
PUNCT O

everyone O
must O
come O
here O
at O

once O
PUNCT O

taking O
hot B-POS
dogs E-POS
to O
the O
next O
level O

at O
first O
glance O
this O
place O
seems O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
a O
hot B-POS
dog E-POS
joint O
PUNCT O
but O
at O
bark S-NEG
you O
do O
n't O
just O
get O
your O
average O
hot B-POS
dog E-POS
PUNCT O

here O
the O
hot B-POS
dog E-POS
is O
elevated O
to O
the O
level O
of O
a O

entree O
with O
numerous O
variations O
available O
PUNCT O

great O
atmosphere S-POS

went O

PUNCT O
the O

in O

a O
bit O
more O
heat O
throughout O
on O
a O
cold O
night O
PUNCT O

poor O
service S-NEG
and O
management S-NEG

do O
n't O
go O
to O
this O
place S-NEG
PUNCT O

had O
an O
awful O
experience O
at O
casa B-NEG
la I-NEG
femme E-NEG
on O
a O
saturday O
dinner O
PUNCT O

when O
the O
main O
course O
finally O
arrived O
another O
45mins O
half O
of O
our O
order O
was O
missing O
PUNCT O

never O
got O
an O
explanation O
as O
to O
what O
was O
going O
on O
PUNCT O

the O
manager S-NEG
was O
rude O
and O
handled O
the O
situation O
extremely O
poorly O
PUNCT O

when O
we O
threatened O
to O
leave O
PUNCT O
we O
were O
offered O
a O
meager O
discount O
even O
though O
half O
the O
order O
was O
missing O
PUNCT O

on O
the O
way O
out O
PUNCT O
we O
heard O
of O
other O
guests O
complaining O
about O
similar O
issues O
PUNCT O

what O
a O
hassle O
PUNCT O

there O
is O
no O
way O
it O
justifies O
the O
accolades O
it O
receives O
PUNCT O
the O
attitude O
of O
the O
staff S-NEG
or O
the O
wait S-NEG
for O
a O
table O
PUNCT O

on O
our O
last O
visit O
PUNCT O
they O
skipped O
over O
our O
name O
on O
the O
list O
PUNCT O
leaving O
us O
waiting O
an O
extra O
hour O
for O
a O
table O
PUNCT O

mistakes O
happen O
PUNCT O
but O
they O
are O
usually O
accompanied O
by O
an O
apology O
PUNCT O
perhaps O
even O
a O
glass O
of O
winebut O
not O
the O
grunt O
that O
we O
received O
from O
the O
al O
di O

staff S-NEG
PUNCT O

without O
the O
wait O
or O
attitude O
PUNCT O
i O
would O
probably O
go O
back O
PUNCT O
but O
there O
are O
just O
too O
many O
other O
restaurants O
in O
brooklyn O
that O
are O
as O
good O
or O
better O
and O
do O
n't O
make O
me O
jump O
through O
hoops O
PUNCT O

expensive O

i O
went O
there O
after O
hearing O
how O
great O
it O
was O
PUNCT O

wow O
PUNCT O

the O
bread S-NEG
was O
stale O
PUNCT O
the O
salad S-NEG
was O
overpriced O
and O
empty O
PUNCT O

the O
pasta S-POS
was O
well O
cooked O
PUNCT O
did O
n't O
have O
enough O
sauce O
though O
or O
flavor O
PUNCT O

i O
though O
it O
was O
expensive O
and O
i O
prefer O
bella O
via O
just O
blocks O
away O
by O
far O
PUNCT O

so O
rude O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

i O
went O
with O
jwils O
PUNCT O

her O
review O
is O
above O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
one O
of O
the O
people O
that O
went O
for O
this O
horrible O
experience O
PUNCT O

my O
friend O
is O
100 O
PUNCT O
right O
in O
the O
experience O
we O
had O
PUNCT O

the O
hostess S-NEG
was O
rude O
and O
i O
got O
a O
distinct O
feeling O
that O
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
serve O
us O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
thing O
that O
my O
friend O
left O
out O
is O
that O
when O
we O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
bar O
the O
bartender S-NEG
disappeared O
PUNCT O

i O
asked O
for O
a O
menu O
and O
the O
same O
waitress S-NEG
looked O
at O
my O
like O
i O
was O
insane O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
shocked O
that O
my O
friends O
wanted O
to O
stay O
after O
the O
waitress S-NEG
said O
PUNCT O
can O
i O
help O
you O
and O
how O
many O
are O
in O
your O
party O
PUNCT O

what O
PUNCT O

the O
three O
of O
us O
standing O
in O
front O
of O
her O
should O
have O
been O
an O
indication O
of O
how O
many O
of O
us O
there O
were O
PUNCT O

we O
did O
n't O
look O
like O
the O
other O
patrons O
in O
there O
so O
unfortunately O
i O
think O
that O
may O
have O
been O
part O
of O
the O
problem O
PUNCT O

shame O
on O
this O
place O
for O
the O
horrible O
rude O
staff S-NEG
and O
non-existent O
customer B-NEG
service E-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
generally O
like O
this O
place S-POS
PUNCT O

the O
food S-POS
is O
good O
PUNCT O

the O
design O
of O
the O
space S-POS
is O
good O
PUNCT O

but O
the O
service S-NEG
is O
horrid O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
there O
for O
brunch O
recently O
PUNCT O
and O
we O
were O
tag O
teamed O
by O
a O
waitress S-NEG
and O
a O
waiter S-NEG
PUNCT O

the O
waiter S-NEG
delivered O
our O
food O
while O
holding O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
plastic O
bag O
of O
garbage O
in O
one O
hand O
PUNCT O

i O
ca O
n't O
believe O
that O
it O
was O
PUNCT O
but O
please O
put O
the O
bag O
down O
before O
delivering O
food O
PUNCT O

the O
waitress S-NEG
came O
to O
check O
in O
on O
us O
every O
few O
minutes O
PUNCT O
and O
began O
to O
clear O
the O
plates O
while O
half O
of O
us O
were O
still O
eating O
a O
big O
pet O
peeve O
of O
mine O
that O
happens O
almost O
everywhere O
PUNCT O
so O
i O
try O
to O
ignore O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
could O
n't O
ignore O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
reach O
over O
the O
plate O
of O
one O
of O
my O
friends O
PUNCT O
who O
was O
in O
mid O
bite O
PUNCT O
to O
clear O
the O
table O
PUNCT O

she O
then O
put O
the O
check O
down O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
PUNCT O
and O
came O
to O
check O
on O
the O
bill O
every O
two O
minutes O
PUNCT O
even O
though O
we O
were O
one O
of O
three O
occupied O
tables O
PUNCT O

i O
wish O
i O
could O
like O
this O
place S-NEG
more O
PUNCT O
and O
i O
wish O
someone O
would O
retrain O
the O
staff S-NEG
