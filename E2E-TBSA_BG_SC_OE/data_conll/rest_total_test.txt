the O

PUNCT O

i O
stumbled O

on O
my O
way O
home O
from O
the O

PUNCT O

the O
management S-NEG
was O
less O

the O

also O
more O
laid-back O

relaxed O
PUNCT O

the O

all O
the O
sweets S-POS
are O
homemade O

the O
worst O
though O
was O
the O
taste S-NEG
PUNCT O

they O
were O
dry O
PUNCT O
stale O

pretty O
flavorless O
PUNCT O

the O
fajita S-NEG
we O
tried O
was O
tasteless O

the O

the O

did O
take O

the O

the O

great O
PUNCT O

only O
suggestion O
is O
that O
you O
skip O
the O

PUNCT O
it O
was O
overpriced O
and O
fell O
short O
on O
taste S-NEG
PUNCT O

food S-POS
was O
decent O
PUNCT O
but O
not O
great O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
no O

why O
this O

so O
often O
overlooked O

from O
the O

you O
walk O

you O

i O
do O

know O
what O
some O

who O
rave O
about O
this O
hot B-NEG

are O
talking O
about O

it O
is O
a O
hidden O
delight O
complete O
with O
a O
quaint O
bar S-POS
and O
good O
food S-POS
PUNCT O

i O
find O
that O
most O
kosher O
restaurants O
are O
average O
to O
good O
PUNCT O
but O
this O
has O
been O
the O
best O
i O
've O
eaten O
so O
far O
PUNCT O

the O
waiters S-NEG
always O
look O
angry O
and O
even O
ignore O
their O
high-tipping O
regulars O
PUNCT O

the O
atmosphere S-POS
is O
very O
nice O
PUNCT O
and O
a O
welcome O
escape O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
si O
mall O
PUNCT O

yes O
PUNCT O
they O
're O
a O
bit O
more O
expensive O
then O
typical O
PUNCT O
but O
then O
again O
PUNCT O
so O
is O
their O
food S-POS
PUNCT O

not O
terrible O
PUNCT O
but O
not O
the O
restaurant O
in O
the O
reviews O

say O
that O
the O

all O

and O
the O

we O
received O
was O
horrible O
PUNCT O
rock O
hard O
and O
cold O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
free O
appetizer B-NEG
of I-NEG
olives E-NEG
was O
disappointing O
PUNCT O

however O
PUNCT O
our O
main B-POS
course E-POS
was O
wonderful O
PUNCT O

i O
had O
fish S-POS
and O
my O
husband O
had O
the O
filet S-POS
PUNCT O
both O
of O
which O
exceeded O
our O
expectations O
PUNCT O

the O
dessert O
we O
had O
a O
pear B-POS
torte E-POS
was O
good O
PUNCT O
but O
PUNCT O
once O
again O
PUNCT O
the O
staff S-NEG
was O
unable O
to O
provide O
appropriate O
drink O
suggestions O
PUNCT O

when O
we O
inquired O
about O
ports O
PUNCT O
the O
waitress S-NEG
listed O
off O
several O
but O
did O
not O
know O
taste O
variations O
or O
cost O
PUNCT O

not O
what O
i O
would O
expect O
for O
the O
price O
and O
prestige O
of O
this O
location S-NEU
PUNCT O

all O
in O
all O
PUNCT O
i O
would O
return O
PUNCT O
as O
it O
was O
a O
beautiful O
restaurant S-POS
PUNCT O
but O
i O
hope O
the O
staff S-NEG
pays O
more O
attention O
to O
the O
little O
details O
in O
the O
future O
PUNCT O

short O
and O
sweet O
PUNCT O
seating S-POS
is O
great O
PUNCT O
it O
's O
romantic O
PUNCT O
cozy O
and O
private O
PUNCT O

the O
boths S-POS
are O
not O
as O
small O
as O
some O
of O
the O
reviews O
make O
them O
out O
to O
look O
they O
're O
perfect O
for O
2 O
people O
PUNCT O

the O
service S-POS
was O
extremely O
fast O
and O
attentivethanks O
to O
the O
service S-POS
button O
on O
your O
table O
but O
i O
barely O
understood O
1 O
word O
when O
the O
waiter S-NEG
took O
our O
order O
PUNCT O

the O
food S-NEU
was O
ok O
and O
fair O
nothing O
to O
go O
crazy O
PUNCT O

over O
PUNCT O

over O
all O
the O
looks S-POS
of O
the O
place O
exceeds O
the O
actual O
meals S-NEG
PUNCT O

so O
what O
you O
really O
end O
up O
paying O
for O
is O
the O
restaurant S-NEG
not O
the O
food S-NEG
PUNCT O

will O
prob O
not O
return O

it O
is O
a O

PUNCT O

in O
the O
food S-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
've O
been O
wanting O
to O
go O
to O
this O
place O
forever O
and O
finally O
got O
a O
table O
PUNCT O

the O
menu S-POS
looked O
great O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
waiter S-POS
was O
very O
nice O
PUNCT O
but O
when O
the O
food S-NEU
came O
PUNCT O
it O
was O
average O
PUNCT O

nevertheless O
PUNCT O
i O
finished O
my O
plate O
PUNCT O
and O
that O
's O
when O
i O
found O
a O
maggot O
in O
mushroom B-NEG
sauce E-NEG
at O
the O
bottom O
PUNCT O

i O
showed O
it O
to O
the O
manager S-POS
PUNCT O
and O
he O
smilingly O
apologized O
and O
brought O
us O
two O
free O
desserts O
but O
did O
not O
ask O
us O
what O
we O
wanted O
and O
so O
brought O
the O
last O
two O
desserts O
we O
would O
have O
asked O
for O
PUNCT O

when O
the O
bill O
came O
PUNCT O
nothing O
was O
comped O
PUNCT O
so O
i O
told O
the O
manager O
very O
politely O
that O
we O
were O
willing O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
wine O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
did O
n't O
think O
i O
should O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
food O
with O
a O
maggot O
in O
it O
PUNCT O

yes O
PUNCT O
i O
ate O
the O
food O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
certainly O
would O
not O
have O
if O
i O
had O
seen O
the O
maggot O
before O
eating O
PUNCT O
and O
i O
was O
at O
this O
point O
fairly O
sick O
to O
my O
stomach O
PUNCT O

the O
manager S-NEG
finally O
said O
he O
would O
comp O
the O
two O
glasses O
of O
wine O
which O
cost O
less O
than O
the O
food O
PUNCT O
and O
made O
it O
seem O
like O
a O
big O
concession O
PUNCT O

we O
paid O
and O
left O
because O
we O
did O
n't O
feel O
like O
arguing O
any O
more O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
and O
cook O
a O

PUNCT O
and O
there O
is O
no O
way O
a O
maggot O
should O
be O
able O
to O
get O
into O
well O
prepared O
food S-NEG

for O
a O
restaurant S-POS
with O
such O
a O

that O

PUNCT O
the O

PUNCT O

the O
entree S-POS
was O
also O
very O
good O
PUNCT O

ca O
n't O
argue O
about O
that O
PUNCT O

they O
are O
clearly O
over O
priced O
PUNCT O

what O
you O
are O
paying O
for O
is O
the O
environment S-NEU
and O
the O
name O
PUNCT O

yes O
PUNCT O
the O
place S-POS
is O
classy O
and O
beautiful O
PUNCT O
but O
they O
most O
certainly O
target O
the O

at O

PUNCT O

i O
read O
reviews O
that O
called O
the O

too O
expensive O
and O
i O
thought O
to O
myself O
PUNCT O
but O
may O
be O
it O
is O
worth O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
wrong O
PUNCT O

the B-NEU
four I-NEU
seasons E-NEU
has O
history O
and O
it O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
landmark O
of O
new O
york O
city O
restaurants O
PUNCT O
but O
trust O
me O
PUNCT O
they O
will O
charge O
you O
through O
the O
nose O
just O
so O
that O
you O
can O
say O
i O
've O
been O
to O
the O
four O
seasons O
restaurant O
PUNCT O

i O
wanted O
to O
go O
there O
to O
see O
if O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
and O
sadly O
PUNCT O
curiousity O
got O
the O
best O
of O
me O
and O
i O
paid O
dearly O
for O
it O
PUNCT O

all O
in O
all O
PUNCT O
the O
food S-POS
was O
great O
except O
for O
the O
dessserts S-NEG
PUNCT O

the O
environment S-NEU
is O
very O
upscale O
and O
you O
will O
see O
a O
lot O
of O
rich O
guys O
with O
trophy O
wives O
or O
just O
highly O
paid O
escorts O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
are O
going O
for O
the O
food S-NEG
PUNCT O
it O
will O
not O
be O
worth O
it O
PUNCT O

yes O
PUNCT O
it O
is O
good O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
've O
had O
better O
for O
cheaper O
PUNCT O

you O
would O
think O
they O
would O
make O
up O
for O
it O
with O
service S-NEG
PUNCT O
sadly O
PUNCT O
no O
PUNCT O

service S-NEG
was O
just O
ok O
PUNCT O
it O
is O
not O
what O
you O
'd O
expect O
for O
PUNCT O
500 O
PUNCT O

terrible O
waste O
of O
money O
scammers O
PUNCT O

i O
agree O
that O
dining O
at O
casa B-NEG
la I-NEG
femme E-NEG
is O
like O
no O
other O
dining O
experience O
PUNCT O

but O
not O
in O
a O
good O
way O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
actually O
offended O
to O
have O
spent O
so O
much O
money O
on O
such O
a O
bad O
experience O
PUNCT O

i O
literally O
just O
got O
back O
home O
after O
visiting O
casa B-NEG
la I-NEG
femme E-NEG
and O
was O
so O
offended O
by O
my O
visit O
felt O
it O
necessary O
to O
try O
and O
warn O
other O
diners O
who O
value O
their O
money O
and O
time O
PUNCT O

we O
went O
to O
celebrate O
two O
birthdays O
and O
wanted O
to O
do O
something O
special O
and O
different O
PUNCT O

our O
visit O
their O
to O
say O
the O
least O
PUNCT O
was O
an O
unpleasant O
and O
costly O
experience O
PUNCT O

and O
even O
more O
so O
unpleasant O
because O
it O
was O
so O
costly O
for O
such O
an O
unpleasant O
experience O
PUNCT O

we O
did O
arrive O
late O
for O
our O
reservation O
so O
i O
can O
not O
complain O
too O
much O
about O
the O
wait S-NEU
for O
a O
table O
PUNCT O

although O
we O
were O
told O
10-15 O
minutes O
and O
it O
was O
more O
like O
45 O
minutes O
PUNCT O

we O
were O
ushered O
to O
the O
bar O
to O
wait O
momentarily O
and O
upon O
arrival O
were O
so O
excited O
PUNCT O

the O
place S-POS
is O
beautiful O
PUNCT O

the O
hostess S-POS
was O
very O
pleasant O
PUNCT O

however O
PUNCT O
our O
PUNCT O
14 O
drinks S-NEG
were O
were O
horrible O
PUNCT O

once O
we O
finally O
got O
a O
table O
PUNCT O
despite O
indicating O
we O
wanted O
an O
alla O
carte O
menu O
we O
were O
pushed O
into O
a O
table O
that O
was O
only O
price O
fixed O
PUNCT O

since O
we O
were O
already O
waiting O
so O
long O
PUNCT O
we O
felt O
we O
had O
no O
other O
choice O
but O
to O
accept O
it O
PUNCT O

our O
experience O
did O
not O
ever O
get O
any O
better O
PUNCT O

for O
each O
course O
we O
waited O
over O
1/2 O
hour O
to O
45 O
minutes O
and O
were O
never O
offered O
a O
drink O
PUNCT O

we O
also O
asked O
for O
hooka O
six O
times O
and O
the O
waiter S-NEG
kept O
telling O
us O
one O
minute O
and O
never O
returning O
with O
the O
hooka O
PUNCT O

after O
the O
4th O
time O
i O
asked O
again O
and O
the O
waiter S-NEG
than O
said O
after O
our O
dinner O
PUNCT O

we O
asked O
for O
beverages O
and O
never O
received O
them O
PUNCT O

we O
asked O
for O
sides O
which O
the O
waiter S-NEG
than O
admitted O
that O
he O
forgot O
to O
put O
in O
that O
part O
of O
our O
order O
PUNCT O

my O
chicken S-NEG
was O
inedible O
as O
there O
were O
so O
many O
fatty O
lumps O
which O
i O
had O
to O
keep O
spitting O
out O
into O
my O
napkin O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
not O
expect O
this O
for O
a O
PUNCT O
55 O
dinner S-NEG
PUNCT O

by O
the O
time O
we O
finished O
our O
dinner O
we O
still O
had O
not O
received O
one O
beverage O
nor O
hooka O
PUNCT O

what O
we O
did O
do O
was O
waste O
3 O
hours O
being O
trapped O
in O
a O
table O
waiting O
and O
waiting O
for O
food O
and O
drinks O
and O
hooka O
some O
of O
which O
we O
never O
received O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
beverage O
we O
did O
receive O
was O
water O
in O
dirty O
glasses O
PUNCT O

to O
top O
it O
all O
off O
the O
main O
reason O
we O
came O
to O
your O
restaurant O
was O
for O
the O
belly O
dancers O
and O
missed O
the O
first O
show O
as O
we O
were O
not O
seated O
yet O
and O
the O
2nd O
belly O
dancer O
only O
danced O
at O
two O
tables O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
never O
made O
it O
around O
to O
the O
other O
half O
of O
the O
restaurant O
PUNCT O

by O
the O
time O
we O
left O
our O
wallets O
were O
empy O
and O
so O
were O
our O
stomachs O
and O
we O
missed O
the O
show O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
see O
following O
our O
dinner O
PUNCT O
which O
would O
have O
been O
acceptable O
if O
we O
got O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience O
of O
good O
food S-NEG
and O
belly O
dancers O
PUNCT O

if O
it O
seemed O
possible O
to O
do O
so O
while O
there O
i O
would O
have O
fought O
my O
bill O
since O
my O
dinner O
portion O
of O
my O
meal S-NEG
was O
inedible O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
never O
left O
a O
restaurant S-NEG
feeling O
as O
if O
i O
was O
abused O
PUNCT O
and O
wasted O
my O
hard O
earned O
money O
PUNCT O

my O
husbands O
birthday O
and O
my O
sons O
was O
not O
as O
it O
was O
intended O
and O
we O
drove O
two O
hours O
to O
spend O
too O
much O
money O
to O
be O
treated O
terribly O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

i O
wish O
i O
could O
be O
refunded O
PUNCT O

do O
n't O
go O
with O
a O
larger O
group O
than O
4 O
PUNCT O

i O
went O
here O
for O
a O
family O
birthday O
dinner O
PUNCT O

five O
of O
us O
walked O
in O
at O
approximately O
6 O
PUNCT O
20 O
on O
a O
thursday O
evening O
PUNCT O

the O
hostess O
said O
wow O
that O
's O
a O
large O
group O
PUNCT O
unless O
you O
are O
n't O
together O
PUNCT O
to O
which O
i O
replied O
no O
we O
are O
PUNCT O
and O
there O
will O
be O
one O
more O
PUNCT O
so O
a O
table O
for O
six O
please O
PUNCT O

at O
first O
we O
were O
a O
little O
taken O
aback O
PUNCT O
as O
this O
seemed O
to O
present O
a O
problem O
PUNCT O
although O
the O
restaurant O
looked O
fairly O
empty O
PUNCT O
but O
they O
hastily O
put O
the O
table O
together O
for O
us O
PUNCT O

the O
menu S-NEU
is O
fairly O
simple O
without O
much O
descriptions O
PUNCT O

there O
was O
no O
tap O
beer S-NEG
that O
evening O
PUNCT O
which O
was O
a O
disappointment O
PUNCT O

not O
much O
of O
a O
selection B-NEG
of I-NEG
bottled I-NEG
beer E-NEG
either O
PUNCT O
we O
went O
with O
brahma O
PUNCT O

the O
appetizers O
we O
ordered O
were O
served O
quickly O
PUNCT O
an O
order O
of O
fried B-POS
oysters I-POS
and I-POS
clams E-POS
were O
delicious O
but O
a O
tiny O
portion O
maybe O
3 O
of O
each O
PUNCT O

the O
lobster B-NEU
knuckles E-NEU
special O
of O
the O
day O
were O
ok O
PUNCT O
but O
pretty O
tasteless O
PUNCT O

i O
believe O
there O
were O
2 O
shrimp O
in O
the O
"salt B-NEG
encrusted I-NEG
shrimp" I-NEG
appetizer E-NEG
PUNCT O

after O
we O
ate O
our O
appetizers O
which O
took O
all O
of O
8 O
minutes O
we O
ordered O
another O
round O
of O
brahma O
's O
PUNCT O
and O
tried O
to O
stall O
a O
little O
as O
we O
waited O
for O
our O
sixth O
dinner O
member O
PUNCT O

the O
waitress O
appeared O
and O
asked O
us O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
order O
PUNCT O

we O
replied O
that O
we O
would O
like O
to O
wait O
5 O
more O
minutes O
if O
that O
was O
okay O
PUNCT O

she O
replied O
well O
it O
would O
be O
more O
convenient O
for O
us O
if O
you O
ordered O
now O
PUNCT O
since O
you O
are O
a O
larger O
party O
PUNCT O
and O
it O
might O
get O
crowded O
PUNCT O

we O
called O
the O
other O
person O
who O
was O
very O
close O
by O
PUNCT O
and O
she O
told O
us O
to O
order O
for O
her O
PUNCT O
so O
we O
did O
PUNCT O

the O
food O
arrived O
in O
about O
15 O
minutes O
PUNCT O

i O
had O
the O
thai B-POS
style I-POS
fried I-POS
sea I-POS
bass E-POS
was O
very O
good O
PUNCT O

everyone O
seemed O
generally O
happy O
with O
their O
food S-POS
PUNCT O
except O
my O
brother O
who O
had O
the O
grilled B-NEG
mahi I-NEG
mahi E-NEG
PUNCT O
seemingly O
drenched O
in O
grapfruit O
juice O
PUNCT O

i O
heard O
the O
lobster B-POS
roll E-POS
was O
excellent O
PUNCT O

they O
seemed O
to O
continue O
to O
rush O
us O
along O
PUNCT O
taking O
plates O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
my O
sister O
still O
had O
her O
fork O
in O
hand O
PUNCT O

all O
in O
all O
the O
food S-POS
was O
good O
PUNCT O
a O
little O
on O
the O
expensive O
side O
PUNCT O
but O
fresh O
PUNCT O

service S-NEG
not O
the O
friendliest O
to O
our O
large O
party O
PUNCT O

probably O
would O
not O
go O
back O
here O
PUNCT O

great O
indian B-POS
food E-POS

i O
lived O
on O
50th O
st O
PUNCT O
and O
wanted O
indian O
one O
day O
so O
decided O
to O
check O
this O
place O
out O
PUNCT O

food S-POS
was O
amazing O
PUNCT O
i O
love O
indian O
food O
and O
eat O
it O
quite O
regularly O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
can O
say O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
i O
've O
had O
PUNCT O

very O
normal O
indian B-NEU
food E-NEU
PUNCT O
but O
done O
really O
well O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
it O
a O
4 O
instead O
of O
5 O
because O
of O
the O
price O
just O
chicken B-NEG
tikka I-NEG
masala E-NEG
PUNCT O
no O
bread O
of O
rice O
PUNCT O
is O
PUNCT O
25 O
PUNCT O
which O
i O
would O
expect O
at O
a O
upscale O
indian O
restaurant O
but O
this O
place S-POS
does O
n't O
have O
an O
upscale O
feel S-NEG
PUNCT O

also O
PUNCT O
waiters S-NEG
try O
to O
push O
more O
food O
on O
you O
PUNCT O
like O
suggest O
things O
as O
if O
they O
are O
complimentary O
when O
they O
actually O
cost O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
appreciate O
places O
or O
people O
that O
try O
to O
drive O
up O
the O
bill O
without O
the O
patron O
's O
knowledge O
so O
that O
was O
a O
huge O
turnoff O
more O
than O
the O
price O
PUNCT O

but O
if O
you O
're O
prepared O
to O
spend O
some O
PUNCT O
and O
remember O
to O
ask O
if O
something O
they O
offer O
is O
complimentary O
PUNCT O
then O
this O

they O

they O

all O

about O

PUNCT O

i O
have O
never O

someone O

fine O
PUNCT O
i O
wont O

you O
for O

however O

once O

PUNCT O
sometimes O
you O
have O
to O

when O

your O

PUNCT O
i O
got O
through O
about O
half O
my O

before O
i O
found O
a O
piece O

accompanied O
by O
a O

more O
disgusting O
PUNCT O
slimy O
PUNCT O
clearly O
bad O
piece O

PUNCT O

not O
one O
to O
jump O
to O
complaints O
hence O
my O
lack O
of O
previous O

PUNCT O
i O
called O
the O
restaurant O
to O
give O
them O
a O

up O
that O
their O
kitchen O
might O
want O
to O
check O
the O
cleanliness O
of O

PUNCT O

my O
main O
concern O
was O
the O
sanity O
of O
the O
food S-NEG
that O
was O
being O
sent O
out O
to O
myself O
and O
others O
PUNCT O

i O
would O

that O

was O
probably O
wrong O

that O
it O
was O
most O
likely O
an O
oyster O
PUNCT O

that O
we O
were O

blacklisted O
from O

the O

it O
was O

as O
if O
this O

menu E-POS
which O
we O
enjoyed O
a O

PUNCT O

the O
service S-POS
was O
spectacular O
as O
the O
waiter S-POS
knew O
everything O
about O
the O
menu O
and O
his O
recommendations O
were O
amazing O
PUNCT O

i O

my O

PUNCT O

dosut O
bibimbap O

nakgi-bokum O
PUNCT O

the O
dishes O
came O
out O
around O
5 O
minutes O
apart O
PUNCT O

the O
bibimbap S-NEU
was O
average O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
stone B-NEG
bowl E-NEG
was O
n't O
even O
close O
to O
sizzling O
PUNCT O

too O
bad O
i O
had O
paid O
an O
extra O
PUNCT O
2 O
for O
the O
stone B-NEG
bowl E-NEG
PUNCT O

the O
nakgi-bokum S-NEG
was O
horrible O
PUNCT O

easily O
the O
worst O
stir-fried B-NEG
squid E-NEG
i O
've O
ever O
tasted O
PUNCT O

the O
sauce S-NEG
tasted O
more O
like O
chinese O
fast O
food O
than O
decent O
korean O
PUNCT O

the O
side B-NEU
dishes E-NEU
were O
passable O
PUNCT O
and O
i O
did O
get O
a O
refill O
upon O
request O
PUNCT O

the O
real O
problem O
i O
had O
with O
this O
place O
was O
the O
complete O
lack O
of O
service S-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
mentioned O
the O
squid O
dish O
was O
n't O
very O
good O
when O
the O
waitress O
visited O
PUNCT O

she O
just O
nodded O
and O
walked O
off O
PUNCT O

there O
were O
no O
communications O
issues O
either O
PUNCT O
as O
she O
spoke O
perfect O
english O
PUNCT O

as O
to O
my O
comment O
about O
the O

PUNCT O
no O
apology O

made O
PUNCT O

my O

had O
barely O
touched O
that O

of O
a O

PUNCT O

we O
were O
charged O
full O

PUNCT O

if O
you O

place O
for O
over O
a O
year O
and O
finally O
had O
dinner O
there O
PUNCT O

we O
've O
tried O
before O
but O
it O
always O
packed O
and O
does O
n't O
take O
reservations O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
well O
worth O
the O
wait O
PUNCT O

the O
wife O
had O
the O
risotto S-POS
which O
was O
amazing O
PUNCT O

it O
does O
n't O
look O
appetizing O
as O
it O
's O
covered O
in O
squid O
ink O
and O
it O
turns O
your O
lips O
and O
teeth O
black O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
taste O
was O
phenomenal O
PUNCT O

the O
farro B-POS
salad E-POS
and O
the O
mashed B-POS
yukon I-POS

were O
also O
extremely O

PUNCT O

a O
quintessential O
slice B-NEU
of I-NEU
nyc I-NEU
pizza E-NEU
PUNCT O

the O
crust S-POS
has O
a O
great O
bite O
and O
a O
good O
chew O
PUNCT O
the O
sauce S-POS
is O
light O
with O
a O
nice O
acidity O
to O
it O
PUNCT O
the O
salt O
from O
the O

is O
great O
PUNCT O
really O
heightens O
the O
flavor O
of O
all O
the O
other O
components O
PUNCT O

personally O
i O
like O
the O
margherita B-POS
pizza E-POS
better O
PUNCT O
but O
they O
are O
all O
good O
PUNCT O

possibly O
the O
most O
romantic O
restaurant S-POS
in O
the O
city O

this O
is O
undoubtedly O
my O
favorite O
modern B-POS
japanese I-POS
brasserie E-POS
that O
do O
n't O
serve O
sushi O
PUNCT O
and O
in O
my O
opinion O
PUNCT O
one O
of O
the O
most O
romantic O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
PUNCT O

not O
only O
is O
it O
an O
adventure O
getting O

this O
somewhat O
hidden O
spot S-NEU
PUNCT O
once O
you O
enter O
the O
unmarked B-POS
wooden I-POS

PUNCT O
the O

PUNCT O
make O
sure O
that O
your O

menu E-POS
PUNCT O
which O

such O
a O
wonderful O

with O
a O
flight O
of O
sake O
PUNCT O

i O
never O
used O

lately O
experimenting O

a O

PUNCT O

we O
started O
off O
with O
a O
delightful O
sashimi B-POS

PUNCT O

our O
first O
course O
was O
tuna O

PUNCT O

i O
picked O
the O
grilled B-POS
black I-POS
cod E-POS
as O
my O
entree O
PUNCT O
which O
i O
absolutely O
devoured O
while O
someone O
commented O
that O
the O
grilled B-POS
salmon I-POS
dish E-POS
was O
better O
PUNCT O

the O
entrees S-NEU
were O
served O
with O
miso O
soup O
and O
rice O
PUNCT O

the O
sake's S-POS
complimented O
the O
courses O
very O
well O
and O
is O
successfully O
easing O
me O
into O
the O
sake O
world O
PUNCT O

for O
desserts O
PUNCT O
we O
tried O
the O
frozen B-NEU
black I-NEU
sesame I-NEU

interesting O
but O
not O
extraordinary O
and O
matcha B-POS
(powdered I-POS
green I-POS
tea) I-POS
and I-POS
blueberry I-POS
cheesecake E-POS
PUNCT O

the O
great O
company O
i O
had O
friends O
visiting O
from O

PUNCT O
yes O
PUNCT O
it O
was O
not O
a O

about O
this O
brasserie S-POS
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
usually O
visit O
the O

a O
quiet O
PUNCT O
unhurried O

with O
my O

PUNCT O

the O
food S-POS
was O
great O

the O

over O

not O

warm O

either O
PUNCT O

i O
must O

i O

by O
the O
bad O

the O

PUNCT O
though O
PUNCT O

maybe O
it O

the O

PUNCT O

how O

this O
palce S-NEG
still O
open O
PUNCT O

i O
honestly O
do O
n't O
even O

where O
to O
begin O
PUNCT O

my O
boyfriend O
and O
i O
are O
avid O
restaurant O
goers O
PUNCT O
and O
we O
are O
always O
on O
the O
lookout O
for O
new O
places O
and O
our O
friend O
had O
recommended O
flatbush O
farms O
PUNCT O

we O
arrived O
and O
were O
seated O
immediately O
PUNCT O
which O
made O
us O
both O
happy O
PUNCT O

we O
ordered O
our O
appetizers O
PUNCT O
i O
ordered O
the O
chicken O
and O
my O
boyfriend O
the O
salmon O
PUNCT O

everything O
was O
going O
good O
until O
we O
got O
our O
meals S-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
took O
one O
look O
at O
the O
chicken S-NEG
and O
i O
was O
appalled O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
served O
with O
skin O
PUNCT O
over O
a O
bed O
of O
extremely O
undercooked O
spinach S-NEG
and O
mashed O
potatoes O
PUNCT O

my O
boyfriend O
asked O
me O
if O
i O
wanted O
to O
switch O
and O
eat O
his O
salmon O
instead O
PUNCT O
while O
he O
de-skinned O
the O
chicken O
so O
that O
i O
could O
enjoy O
the O
white O
meat O
PUNCT O

i O
took O
one O
bite O
from O
the O
PUNCT O
24 O
salmon S-NEG
PUNCT O
and O
i O
have O
never O
PUNCT O
in O
the O
17 O
years O
i O
have O
been O
going O
to O
restaurants O
tasted O
salmon S-NEG
as O
fishy O
PUNCT O
as O
dry O
PUNCT O
and O
as O
bland O
as O
the O
one O
in O
flatbush O
farms O
PUNCT O

at O
this O
point O
PUNCT O
the O
waitress S-NEG
comes O
over O
and O
asks O
us O
if O
everything O
was O
okay O
PUNCT O
i O
was O
literally O
so O
shocked O
that O
i O
was O
speechless O
and O
did O
n't O
say O
anything O
PUNCT O
and O
guess O
what O
PUNCT O
the O
waitress S-NEG
walked O
away O
PUNCT O

so O
PUNCT O
i O
switch O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
again O
to O
see O
if O
maybe O
i O
could O
stomach O
the O
meat O
and O
spinach S-NEG
again O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
spinach S-NEG
was O
so O
undercooked O
that O
i O
just O
could O
not O
bite O
through O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
could O
n't O
even O
enjoy O
the O
mashed O
potatoes O
because O
it O
was O
hidden O
completely O
under O
the O
chicken O
and O
spinach O
PUNCT O

i O
've O
had O
better O
chicken O
at O
bbqs O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

so O
i O
decide O
to O
report O
back O
to O
the O
waitress O
because O
it O
was O
completely O
inedible O
PUNCT O

guess O
what O
PUNCT O
i O
waited O
for O
twenty O
minutes O
before O
she O
came O
over O
and O
when O
she O
finally O
did O
PUNCT O
she O
says O
PUNCT O
oh O
well O
PUNCT O
i O
wish O
you O
would O
have O
said O
something O
earlier O
no O
apology O
PUNCT O
nothing O
PUNCT O

after O
that O
she O
simply O
took O
our O
plates O
PUNCT O
walked O
away O
PUNCT O
came O
back O
another O
twenty O
minutes O
later O
with O
the O
bill O

on O
it O

PUNCT O
my O

took O
the O
bill O
and O
went O
to O
find O
the O

PUNCT O

this O
is O
where O
it O
really O
really O
gets O
bad O
PUNCT O
the O
manager S-NEG
said O
PUNCT O
there O

absolutely O
nothing O
we O

PUNCT O
it O

up O
for O
it O
PUNCT O
nothing O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

we O
refused O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
because O
at O
this O
point O
it O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
food O
anymore O
PUNCT O

the O
level O
of O
rudeness O
was O
preposterous O
PUNCT O

the O
manager S-NEG
came O
to O
the O
table O
and O
said O
we O
can O
do O
what O
we O
want O
PUNCT O
so O
we O
paid O
for O
what O
we O
did O
enjoy O
PUNCT O
the O
drinks S-POS
and O
appetizers S-POS
PUNCT O
and O
walked O
out O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
never O

had O
such O
an O

this O

PUNCT O

the O
reason O
there O
are O
4 O
different O
results O
on O

for O
the O
same O
place O
is O
because O
they O
keep O

they O

PUNCT O

this O
place S-NEG
where O
do O

begin O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
quite O
a O
spectacular O
scene S-POS
i O
'll O
give O
them O
that O
PUNCT O

the O
decor S-NEU
however O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
distraction O
so O
you O
wo O

notice O
that O
you O
just O
payed O

PUNCT O

how O
this O

survives O
the O
competitive O
west O

PUNCT O
or O
any O
other O
for O

make O
your O

very O
happy O
PUNCT O

only O
complaint O
is O
the O

a O

less O
on O

listed O
on O

but O
nonetheless O
-- O
great O
spot S-POS
PUNCT O
great O
food S-POS
PUNCT O

fabulous O
food S-POS
PUNCT O
if O
the O
front B-NEG

do O
n't O
put O
you O
off O

we O
live O

it O

a O
little O
out O
of O
our O
price O

there O
except O
on O
special O

PUNCT O
but O
we O
've O
eaten O
there O
6 O
times O
in O
the O
last O
2 O
years O
PUNCT O

each O
time O
we O
've O
been O
PUNCT O
the O
front B-NEG
of I-NEG
house I-NEG
staff E-NEG
not O
the O
waiters S-POS
PUNCT O
they O
're O
fantastic O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
people O
who O
greet O
and O
seat O
you O
has O
been O
so O
hideous O
to O
us O
that O
were O
it O
not O
for O
the O
exceptional O
fish B-POS
dishes E-POS
i O
would O
never O
return O
PUNCT O

as O
bfc S-NEG
does O
n't O
take O
reservations O
you O
almost O
always O
have O
to O
wait O
by O
the O
bar O
PUNCT O
and O
be O
abused O
by O
the O
front B-NEG
of I-NEG
house I-NEG
staff E-NEG
until O
you O
are O
seated O
PUNCT O
which O
can O
be O
over O
an O
hour O
later O
PUNCT O

the O
frizzy O
retro O
girl S-NEG
with O
winged/ O
dame O
edna O
glasses O
will O
yell O
at O
you O
if O
you O
try O
to O
order O
a O
drink O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
almost O
amused O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
was O
turning O
away O
customers O
at O
9pm O
on O
a O
friday O
night O
because O
she O
had O
a O
bbq O
to O
go O
to O
that O
night O
PUNCT O
wtf O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

i O
'd O
be O
horrified O
if O
my O
staff S-NEG
were O
turning O
away O
customers O
so O
early O
and O
so O
rudely O
PUNCT O

there O
's O
another O
girl S-NEG
who O
i O
ca O
n't O
describe O
PUNCT O
she O
is O
about O
5'6 O
with O
brown O
hair O
PUNCT O
who O
eavesdrops O
on O
your O
conversation O
and O
chimes O
in O
PUNCT O
except O
she O
only O
hears O
the O
last O
part O
of O
what O
you O
said O
PUNCT O
so O
her O
uninvited O
opinions O
are O
often O
out O
of O
context O
and O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
what O
you O
're O
*really* O
talking O
about O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
a O
friendly O
person O
PUNCT O
so O
i O
would O
n't O
mind O
had O
she O
not O
been O
so O
nasty O
and O
gotten O
so O
personal O
PUNCT O

again O
PUNCT O
i O
'd O
be O
super O
upset O
if O
that O
were O
my O
employee O
PUNCT O

considering O
you O
will O
spend O
at O
least O
PUNCT O
60 O
a O
head O
PUNCT O
i O
expect O
better O
service S-NEG
PUNCT O

so O
PUNCT O
if O
you O
're O
walking O
by O
and O
thinking O
about O
dining O
PUNCT O
you O
might O
want O
to O
see O
who O
's O
going O
to O
be O
seating O
you O
first O
PUNCT O

maitre-d S-NEG
and O
get O

my O

last O
weekend O
PUNCT O

the O
food S-POS

fine O
PUNCT O
however O
the O
maitre-d S-NEG
was O
incredibly O
unwelcoming O

arrogant O
PUNCT O

while O

included O
a O
high-end O
bottle B-POS

PUNCT O
our O

this O
guy O
refused O

she O
left O
PUNCT O
followed O
shortly O
by O
the O
four O
of O
us O
PUNCT O

not O

told O
him O
that O
in O
my O
40 O
years O
of O

PUNCT O
that O
i O

a O

his O

totally O

this O

seems O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
a O

at O

you O
do O

PUNCT O

here O
the O

poor O

the O

believe O
how O
an O
expensive O

PUNCT O

what O
a O

PUNCT O

the O

very O
good O

are O
just O
too O
many O
other O
restaurants O
in O
brooklyn O
that O
are O
as O
good O
or O
better O
and O
do O
n't O
make O
me O
jump O
through O

PUNCT O

expensive O

i O
went O
there O
after O
hearing O
how O
great O
it O
was O
PUNCT O

wow O
PUNCT O

the O
bread S-NEG
was O
stale O
PUNCT O
the O
salad S-NEG
was O
overpriced O
and O
empty O
PUNCT O

the O
pasta S-POS
was O
well O
cooked O
PUNCT O
did O
n't O
have O
enough O
sauce O
though O
or O
flavor O
PUNCT O

i O
though O
it O
was O
expensive O
and O
i O
prefer O
bella O
via O
just O
blocks O
away O
by O
far O
PUNCT O

so O
rude O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

i O
went O
with O
jwils O
PUNCT O

her O
review O
is O
above O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
one O
of O
the O
people O
that O
went O
for O
this O
horrible O
experience O
PUNCT O

my O
friend O
is O
100 O
PUNCT O
right O
in O
the O
experience O
we O
had O
PUNCT O

the O
hostess S-NEG
was O
rude O
and O
i O
got O
a O
distinct O
feeling O
that O
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
serve O
us O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
thing O
that O
my O
friend O
left O
out O
is O
that O
when O
we O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
bar O
the O
bartender S-NEG
disappeared O
PUNCT O

i O
asked O
for O
a O
menu O
and O
the O
same O
waitress S-NEG
looked O
at O
my O
like O
i O
was O
insane O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
shocked O
that O
my O
friends O
wanted O
to O
stay O
after O
the O
waitress S-NEG
said O
PUNCT O
can O
i O
help O
you O
and O
how O
many O
are O
in O
your O
party O
PUNCT O

what O
PUNCT O

the O
three O
of O
us O
standing O
in O
front O
of O
her O
should O
have O
been O
an O
indication O
of O
how O
many O
of O
us O
there O
were O
PUNCT O

we O
did O
n't O
look O
like O
the O
other O
patrons O
in O
there O
so O
unfortunately O
i O
think O
that O
may O
have O
been O
part O
of O
the O
problem O
PUNCT O

shame O
on O
this O
place O
for O
the O
horrible O
rude O
staff S-NEG
and O
non-existent O
customer B-NEG
service E-NEG
PUNCT O

bad O
staff S-NEG

i O
generally O
like O
this O
place S-POS
PUNCT O

the O
food S-POS
is O
good O
PUNCT O

the O
design O
of O
the O
space S-POS
is O
good O
PUNCT O

but O
the O
service S-NEG
is O
horrid O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
there O
for O
brunch O
recently O
PUNCT O
and O
we O
were O
tag O
teamed O
by O
a O
waitress S-NEG
and O
a O
waiter S-NEG
PUNCT O

the O
waiter S-NEG
delivered O
our O
food O
while O
holding O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
plastic O
bag O
of O
garbage O
in O
one O
hand O
PUNCT O

i O
ca O
n't O
believe O
that O
it O
was O
PUNCT O
but O
please O
put O
the O
bag O
down O
before O
delivering O
food O
PUNCT O

the O
waitress S-NEG
came O
to O
check O
in O
on O
us O
every O
few O
minutes O
PUNCT O
and O
began O
to O
clear O
the O
plates O
while O
half O
of O
us O
were O
still O
eating O
a O
big O
pet O
peeve O
of O
mine O
that O
happens O
almost O
everywhere O
PUNCT O
so O
i O
try O
to O
ignore O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
could O
n't O
ignore O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
reach O
over O
the O
plate O
of O
one O
of O
my O
friends O
PUNCT O
who O
was O
in O
mid O
bite O
PUNCT O
to O
clear O
the O
table O
PUNCT O

she O
then O
put O
the O
check O
down O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
PUNCT O
and O
came O
to O
check O
on O
the O
bill O
every O
two O
minutes O
PUNCT O
even O
though O
we O
were O
one O
of O
three O
occupied O
tables O
PUNCT O

i O
wish O
i O
could O
like O
this O

great O
sushi S-POS
and O
even O
better O

PUNCT O

the O

the O
honey B-NEG
walnut I-NEG

PUNCT O
the O
few O
they O
actually O
give O
youwere O
not O
good O
PUNCT O

the O
prices O
are O
outrageous O
PUNCT O
especially O
since O
the O

was O
actually O
less O
satisfying O
than O
most O
neighborhood O
chinese O
establishments O
PUNCT O

nice O
ambience S-POS
PUNCT O

worst O
service S-NEG
we O
had O

received O
PUNCT O

our O
waiter S-NEG
was O
non-existent O

from O

the O

was O
great O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
*very* O
reasonably O

i O

the O

PUNCT O

finally O
a O
meal S-POS
that O
you O
will O
remember O
for O
a O
long O
time O
PUNCT O

in O
a O
age O
of O
incremental O
cost O
cutting O
in O
restaurants O
PUNCT O
its O
nice O
to O
see O
a O
place O
that O
bucks O
that O
trend O
PUNCT O
and O
just O
plain O
delivers O
high O
quality O
food S-POS
and O
good O
service S-POS
PUNCT O
period O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
the O
place S-POS
to O
relax O
and O
enjoy O
the O
finest O
quality O
food S-POS
the O
industry O
can O
offer O
PUNCT O

caution O
PUNCT O
its O
real O
food S-POS
for O
people O
who O
love O
the O
best O
PUNCT O

some O
of O
the O
food O
is O
clearly O
oriented O
toward O
foodies O
like O
me O
so O
if O
your O
not O
a O
foodie O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
that O
head O
over O
to O
mcdonalds O
or O
some O
ruby O
tuesday O
and O
have O
at O
it O
PUNCT O

if O
your O
looking O
for O
real O
quality O
not O
the O
bs O
that O
is O
seen O
on O
yelp O
ratings O
PUNCT O
which O
allegedly O
recently O
got O
in O
trouble O
for O
adjusting O
ratings O
PUNCT O
you O
need O
to O
get O
in O
here O
PUNCT O

very O
disappointing O

i O
took O
my O
parents O
here O
for O
their O
anniversary-very O
very O
disappointed O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

i O
liked O
the O
atmosphere S-POS
very O
much O
but O
the O
food S-NEG
was O
not O
worth O
the O
price O
PUNCT O

i O
may O
not O
be O
a O
sushi O
guru O
but O
i O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
the O
food S-NEG
here O
is O
just O
okay O
and O
that O
there O
is O
not O
much O
else O
to O
it O
PUNCT O

rice S-NEG
is O
too O
dry O
PUNCT O
tuna S-NEG
was O
n't O
so O
fresh O
either O
PUNCT O

nothing O
really O
came O
across O
as O
outstanding O
PUNCT O

very O
disappointed O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
eaten O
here O
three O
times O
and O
have O
found O
the O
quality O
and O
variety O
of O
the O
fish S-POS
to O
be O
excellent O
PUNCT O

however O
PUNCT O
the O
value O
and O
service S-NEG
are O
both O
severely O
lacking O
PUNCT O

portions O
contain O
less O
fish O
than O
one O
would O
expect O
PUNCT O
particularly O
since O
prices O
are O
in O
line O
with O
the O
best O
sushi O
places O
in O
nyc O
masa O
excluded O
PUNCT O
of O
course O
PUNCT O

furthermore O
PUNCT O
while O
the O
fish S-POS
is O
unquestionably O
fresh O
PUNCT O
rolls S-NEG
tend O
to O
be O
inexplicably O
bland O
PUNCT O

the O
service S-NEG
ranges O
from O
mediocre O
to O
offensive O
PUNCT O

on O
a O
recent O
trip O
PUNCT O
our O
waiter S-NEG
was O
extremely O
dismissive O
PUNCT O
while O
no O
less O
than O
three O
staff B-NEG
members E-NEG
waited O
hand-and-foot O
on O
a O
pair O
of O
japanese O
girls O
seated O
nearby O
PUNCT O

we O
were O
then O
charged O
for O
their O
most O
expensive O
sake O
PUNCT O
20+ O
per O
serving O
when O
we O
in O
fact O
drank O
a O
sake O
of O
less O
than O
half O
that O
price O
PUNCT O

but O
im O
sure O
this O
was O
just O
an O
honest O
mistake O
PUNCT O

freshest O
sushi S-POS
PUNCT O
i O
love O
this O
restaurant S-POS
PUNCT O

they O
pay O
such O
detail O
to O
everything O
from O
miso B-POS
soup E-POS
to O
complex O
rolls S-POS
PUNCT O

the O
sashimi S-POS
was O
the O
freshest O
and O
most O
tender O
i O
have O
ever O
tasted O
PUNCT O

their O
apps S-POS
are O
all O
delicious O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
drawback O
is O
that O
this O
place S-NEG
is O
really O
expensive O
and O
the O
portions S-NEG
are O
on O
the O
small O
side O
PUNCT O

but O
the O
space S-POS
is O
small O
and O
lovely O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
service S-POS
is O
helpful O
PUNCT O

you O
are O
bound O
to O
have O
a O
very O
charming O
time O
PUNCT O

not O
recommanded O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

the O
food S-NEG
was O
not O
great O
PUNCT O
the O
waiters S-NEG
were O
rude O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
not O
worth O
going O
at O
all O
and O
spend O
your O
money O
there O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

great O
service S-POS

pretty O
cheap O
for O

down O
mexican O
and O
downtown O
PUNCT O

my O
service S-POS
was O
stellar O
PUNCT O

the O
bus B-POS
boy E-POS
even O
spotted O
that O
my O
table O
was O
shaking O
a O
stabilized O
it O
for O
me O
PUNCT O

food S-POS
was O
fine O

some O

if O
you O

day O
PUNCT O

the O
food S-POS
was O
great O
PUNCT O
the O

too O
but O
the O
waitress S-NEG
was O
too O
busy O
being O
nice O
to O
her O
other O
larger O
party O
than O
to O
take O
better O
care O
of O
my O

our O
order O

water O

the O

was O
when O

asked O

my O
only O
negative O
comment O
is O
that O
i O
wish O
the O
pieces S-NEG

a O
little O
bigger O
PUNCT O

the O
decor S-NEU
is O
rustic O
PUNCT O
traditional O
japanese O
PUNCT O

the O
crowd S-NEU
is O
mixed O
yuppies O
PUNCT O
young O
and O
old O
PUNCT O

the O
service S-POS
was O
courteous O
and O
attentive O
PUNCT O

mediocre O
food S-NEU

we O
ate O
on O
the O
outside O
patio O
area O
for O
dinner O
on O
a O
saturday O
night O
PUNCT O

the O
outside O

ordered O
the O
marinated O

PUNCT O
buffalo O

chicken O

PUNCT O
and O
the O
turkey O

PUNCT O

my O
g/f O
and O
i O
both O
agreed O
the O
food S-NEG
was O
very O
mediocre O
especially O
considering O
the O
price O
PUNCT O

we O
are O
locals O
PUNCT O
and O
get O
the O
feeling O
the O
only O
way O
this O
place S-NEG
survives O
with O
such O
average O
food S-NEG
is O
because O
most O
customers O
are O
probably O
one-time O
customer O
tourists O
PUNCT O

service S-NEU
was O
decent O
PUNCT O

drinks S-POS
were O
good O
PUNCT O

unless O
you O
are O
just O
stopping O
in O
for O
a O
few O
drinks S-POS
i O
would O
n't O
recommend O
going O
here O
PUNCT O

you O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
disappointed O
PUNCT O

excellent O
food S-POS
PUNCT O
nice O
ambience S-POS
PUNCT O
fairly O

gnocchi E-POS
5 O
big O
ones O
to O
a O

little O
gnocchis O
and O
my O

loved O
her O
filet B-POS
mignon I-POS
on I-POS
top I-POS
of I-POS
spinach I-POS
and I-POS
mashed I-POS
potatoes E-POS
PUNCT O

the O
ambiance S-POS
was O
a O
peaceful O
and O
relaxing O
break O
amongst O
all O
the O
kids O
running O
around O
in O
downtown O
disney O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
romantic O
PUNCT O
and O
even O
nice O
even O
with O
my O
sister O
PUNCT O
reminded O
me O
of O
italy O
PUNCT O
and O
had O
artwork S-POS
and O
music S-POS
that O
kept O
up O
the O
feeling O
of O
being O
in O
a O
mediterrean O
villa O
PUNCT O

i O
recommend O
it O
for O
a O
night O
when O
you O
want O

splurge O
PUNCT O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
expensive O

mild O

the O

PUNCT O
it O
looked O
just O
as O

as O
it O

my O

the O

hummus S-POS
in O

with O
a O

fragrant O
olive O

which O
PUNCT O
i O
believe O
is O
the O
traditional O
way O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
drawback O
is O
the O
crowded O
seating S-NEG
and O
the O
slow O

PUNCT O

there O
have O
been O
several O
occasions O
when O
we O

my O
first O

was O
with O
my O

it O
was O
absolutely O
horrible O
PUNCT O

we O
waited O
over O
30 O
minutes O
for O
our O
drinks O
and O
over O
1 O
1/2 O
hours O
for O
our O
food O
PUNCT O

i O
swore O
never O
to O
return O
for O
a O
warm O
beer S-NEG
and O
mediocre O
meal S-NEG
PUNCT O

however O
PUNCT O
one O
sunday O

did O
go O

with O
my O
loud O

and O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
PUNCT O

the O
band S-POS
was O
very O
good O
and O
the O
service S-POS
was O
attentive O
PUNCT O

outside O
in O
the O

between O
the O

and O
the O

PUNCT O
children O
were O
running O
around O

their O

it O

like O
dining O
at O
a O
completely O
different O
restaurant O
PUNCT O

we O
have O
since O
returned O
and O
also O
had O
a O
great O

sampling O
more O

a O

cold O
and O
good O
PUNCT O

we O
did O
have O
the O
same O
waiter S-POS
the O
second O
time O
PUNCT O
so O
maybe O
the O
service O
is O
spotty O
and O
our O
luck O
is O
good O

sunday O

i O
hope O

we O

my O

PUNCT O

it O
's O
a O
great O
little O
place S-POS

of O
potential O
to O
be O
a O

if O
the O

n't O
so O
impersonal O
and O
corporate-like O
PUNCT O

PUNCT O

best O
chinese B-POS
food E-POS
i O
have O
tasted O
in O
a O
long O
time O

we O
got O
a O
groupon O
for O
pagoda O
and O
decided O
to O
try O
it O
on O
a O
thursday O
night O
PUNCT O

there O
was O
a O
guy O
playing O
the O
piano O
and O
singing O
at O
the O
bar O
area O
which O
was O
separate O
from O
the O
dinning O
area O
PUNCT O

you O
can O
easily O
hear O
him O
though O
so O
it O
was O
a O
pleasant O
sound O
and O
not O
overbearing O
PUNCT O

the O
ambiance S-POS
of O
the O
restaurant O
was O
nice O
and O
good O
for O
fine O
dinning O
PUNCT O

not O
too O
fine O
thought O
that O
you O
feel O
uncomfortable O
and O
have O
to O
dress O
up O
PUNCT O

the O
staff S-POS
was O
very O
nice O
and O
courteous O
and O
obviously O
chinese O
PUNCT O

we O
ordered O
the O
honey O
walnut O
prawns O
which O
we O
always O
order O
at O
every O
chinese O
restaurant O
to O
determine O
the O
quality O
of O
food O
PUNCT O

first O
off O
PUNCT O
the O
food O
came O
fast O
and O
all O
together O
PUNCT O
i O
like O
that O
i O
hate O
the O
pretentiousness O
of O
things O
coming O
in O
one O
after O
the O
other O
PUNCT O

so O
about O
the O
prawns S-POS
PUNCT O
they O
were O
fresh O
and O
had O
a O
slight O
crispiness O
about O
the O
batter S-POS
soooo O
good O
the O
walnuts S-POS
were O
cut O
in O
smaller O
pieces O
and O
very O
crunchy O
and O
tasty O
PUNCT O

yummy O
PUNCT O

best O
honey B-POS
walnyt I-POS
prawns E-POS
that O
we O
have O
every O
tasted O
PUNCT O

next O
one O
that O
we O
ordered O
were O
prawns O
and O
scallop O
with O
brocolli O
PUNCT O

the O
brocollis S-POS
were O
so O
fresh O
and O
tasty O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
normally O
not O
finish O
the O
brocolli S-POS
when O
i O
order O
these O
kinds O
of O
food O
but O
for O
the O
first O
time O
PUNCT O
every O
piece O
was O
as O
eventful O
as O
the O
first O
one O
the O
scallops S-POS
and O
prawns S-POS
was O
so O
fresh O
and O
nicely O
cooked O
PUNCT O

not O
chewy O
at O
all O
PUNCT O

for O
desert O
we O
had O
the O
mango B-POS
ginger I-POS
creme I-POS

oh O
la O

yummy O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

melt O
in O
your O
mouth O
PUNCT O

we O
are O
for O
sure O
coming O
back O
to O
this O
restaurant S-POS
PUNCT O

every O
month O
if O
possible O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
sad O
there O
is O
not O
many O
people O
who O
frequent O
eating O
at O
places O
like O
these O
that O
look O
pricey O
because O
they O
are O
at O
the O
hotel O
but O
they O
are O
definitely O
one O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
miss O
PUNCT O
esp O
if O
your O
in O
downtown O
san O
jose O
PUNCT O

chintzy O
portions S-NEG

the O
sushi S-POS
here O
is O
perfectly O
good O
PUNCT O
but O
for O
PUNCT O
5 O
a O
piece O
PUNCT O
either O
the O
slices O
of O
fish O
should O
be O
larger O
PUNCT O
or O
there O
should O
be O
no O
pretense O
that O
this O
is O
a O
moderately O
priced O
restaurant S-NEG
even O
for O
nyc O
PUNCT O

we O
easily O
spent O
more O
than O
PUNCT O
40 O
per O
person O
not O
including O
alcohol O
and O
were O
still O
hungry O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
astonished O
that O
this O
restaurant S-NEG
is O
categorized O
as O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
rather O
than O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

terrible O
service S-NEG
PUNCT O
food S-NEU
ok O
PUNCT O
pricey O

this O
past O
weekend O
had O
great O
weather O
for O
san O
francisco O
standards O
PUNCT O

so O
for O
the O
after O
beach O
excursion O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
we O
thought O
we O
would O
end O
the O
day O
on O
a O
high O
note O
and O
make O
the O
trip O
across O
the O
street O
from O
the O
beach O
to O
park O
chalet O
PUNCT O

the O
restaurant O
was O
busy O
PUNCT O
however O
there O
were O
a O
few O
tables O
open O
PUNCT O

we O
put O
out O
name O
down O
and O
although O
there O
were O
open O
tables O
we O
were O
told O
that O
it O
'd O
be O
a O
30 O
minute O
wait O
PUNCT O

so O
here O
we O
are O
PUNCT O
my O
wife O
PUNCT O
3 O
year O
old O
daughter O
and O
i O
trying O
to O
pass O
the O
time O
by O
hanging O
out O
in O
the O
front O
of O
the O
building O
where O
the O
murals O
and O
artifacts O
are O
PUNCT O

30 O
minutes O
went O
by O
and O
sure O
enough O
the O
pager O
buzzer O
went O
off O
PUNCT O

we O
went O
back O
to O
the O
restaurant O
and O
low O
and O
behold O
PUNCT O
we O
were O
seated O
at O
one O
of O
the O
tables O
that O
was O
available O
30 O
minutes O
ago O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

logic O
behind O
that O
PUNCT O

none O
that O
i O
can O
think O
of O
PUNCT O

we O
put O
in O
our O
order O
and O
although O
we O
ordered O
4 O
appetizers O
PUNCT O
the O
food O
did O
n't O
arrive O
until O
45 O
minutes O
laterwith O
our O
main O
course O
PUNCT O

um O
so O
now O
what O
are O
appetizers O
for O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

oh O
i O
forgot O
to O
mention O
that O
they O
do O
n't O
have O
bread O
service O
PUNCT O

its O
a O
good O
thing O
my O
daughter O
had O
some O
snacks O
in O
her O
lunch O
bag O
PUNCT O

my O
wife O
also O
ordered O
a O
teapot O
of O
hot O
water O
she O
had O
a O
sore O
throat O
and O
i O
guess O
that O
since O
it O
was O
only O
water O
PUNCT O
it O
was O
n't O
a O
priority O
for O
them O
to O
actually O
bring O
it O
PUNCT O

in O
other O
words O
PUNCT O
if O
they O
are O
n't O
making O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O
off O
of O
you O
then O
you O
do O
n't O
rate O
high O
on O
their O
service S-NEG
scale O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

food S-NEU
wise O
PUNCT O
its O
ok O
but O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
what O
you O
get O
considering O
the O
restaurant S-NEG
is O
n't O
a O
fancy O
place O
PUNCT O

the O
upside O
of O
the O
restaurant O
PUNCT O

if O
i O
needed O
to O
name O
some O
they O
would O
include O
the O
location S-POS
to O
the O
beach O
or O
golden O
gate O
park O
PUNCT O

its O
great O
if O
you O
spent O
the O
day O
there O
and O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
drive O
to O
eat O
PUNCT O

parking O
is O
reasonably O
good O
PUNCT O
they O
have O
their O
own O
lot O
and O
you O
can O
park O
in O
the O
park O
nearby O
PUNCT O

another O
plus O
is O
the O
open O
feel S-POS
of O
the O
restaurant O
with O
glass B-POS
walls E-POS
on O
all O
sides O
PUNCT O

i O
'd O
hate O
for O
tourists O
to O
go O
to O
park O

and O
think O
that O
this O
is O
how O
all O
san O

are O
like O
PUNCT O

always O
good O

a O

their O

while O
this O

PUNCT O
the O
restaurant B-NEG
staff E-NEG
seemed O
completely O
indifferent O
to O
our O
presence O
PUNCT O
and O
this O
attitude O
was O
reflected O
in O
the O
lack O
of O
service O
PUNCT O

as O
part O
of O
a O
small O
party O
of O
four O
PUNCT O
our O

when O

were O

PUNCT O

a O
brief O
conversation O
with O
the O

at O
the O

of O
the O

was O
the O
greatest O
disappointment O

to O

be O
an O

PUNCT O
PUNCT O
a O
strange O
comment O

we O

PUNCT O

it O

the O

the O
taste O
and O
presentation O
was O
ok O
PUNCT O

before O
the O

came O
PUNCT O
the O
server O
told O
us O
that O
the O

with O
any O

suggested O
i O
pick O
something O
from O
the O

PUNCT O

i O
picked O
the O
asparagus S-POS
PUNCT O
which O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
incredible O
and O
perfectly O
prepared O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
steamed O

tossed O
with O

PUNCT O

the O

PUNCT O
at O

initially O
PUNCT O

the O
steak S-POS
was O
done O
to O
my O
exact O
liking O
medium O

juicy O
PUNCT O

it O
PUNCT O
s O
served O
with O
either O
a O

red B-NEU

PUNCT O
though O
both O
were O
indistinguishable O
in O

PUNCT O

though O
PUNCT O
one O
thing O
i O
realized O
later O
on O
was O
that O
the O

either O
used O
msg O
or O
a O
meat O
tenderizer O
on O
the O
steak S-NEG
PUNCT O

my O
mouth O
felt O
very O
dry O
afterwards O

i O
had O
that O
signature O
PUNCT O
msg O
PUNCT O
taste O
lingering O
in O
my O
throat O
after O
i O
left O
the O
restaurant O
PUNCT O

PUNCT O
the O
homemade O

PUNCT O

the O

PUNCT O
we O

PUNCT O

at O

PUNCT O
the O

very O
busy O
PUNCT O
which O

accounts O
for O

the O

PUNCT O

i O
should O
have O
just O
asked O
for O
the O

when O
i O
saw O
that O

but O
their O
menu S-POS
was O
so O
unique O
that O
i O
continued O
PUNCT O

the O
pancakes S-POS
were O
certainly O
inventive O
but O
PUNCT O
850 O

over-priced O
PUNCT O

the O
pancakes S-NEG
should O
be O
larger O
at O

to O
justify O
the O
expense O
even O
with O
the O
unique O

PUNCT O

the O
flavors O
were O
good O
but O
i O
have O
had O
far O
better O
pancakes O
at O

that O
were O
a O
little O
cheaper O

significan'tly O
larger O

on O
my O

i O
had O

breaking O
the O
yokes O
before O

would O
have O
had O
to O
send O

again O
if O
i O
had O
n't O
rejected O
the O
meal S-NEG
all O
together O
PUNCT O

i O
rejected O
it O
because O
in O
the O
process O
of O
attempting O

fix O
the O
eggs O
they O
broke O
something O
else O
in O
the O
dish S-NEG

i O
was O
too O
frustrated O
to O
continue O

to O
their O
credit O
they O
removed O
the O

from O

i O
had O
suspected O

imagine O

our O

continued O

who O

an O
appropriate O

PUNCT O
you O
get O
the O
idea O
PUNCT O

all O
considered O
PUNCT O
i O
have O
to O
say O
that O
ray's B-POS
boathouse E-POS
is O
deserving O
of O
its O
title O
as O
a O
seattle O
institution O
PUNCT O

while O
i O
could O
have O
done O
without O
the O

the O

our O
wonderful O
