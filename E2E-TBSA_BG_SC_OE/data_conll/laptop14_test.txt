luckily O
PUNCT O
for O
all O

us O
contemplating O
the O

PUNCT O
the O

just O
right O
PUNCT O

small O

everything O
just O

only O
problem O
that O

was O
that O
the O

not O
very O
good O
for O
me O
PUNCT O
i O
only O
had O
a O
problem O
once O
or O
twice O
with O
it O
PUNCT O
but O
probably O
my O

was O
a O
bit O
defective O
PUNCT O

and O
if O
you O
are O
switching O
from O

i O
hilghy O
sugest O
this O
one O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
super O
fast O

but O
the O
mountain B-NEG

is O
just O
too O
slow O
PUNCT O

strong O
build S-POS
though O
which O
really O
adds O
to O
its O
durability S-POS
PUNCT O

the O
battery B-POS
life E-POS

excellent O
6-7 O

i O
enjoy O

i O
've O
had O
my O

for O
2 O

already O
and O
it O
works S-POS
perfectly O
PUNCT O

i O
will O
never O
go O
back O
to O
a O

again O
PUNCT O

and O
i O
may O
be O
the O
only O
one O
but O
i O
am O
really O
liking O
windows B-POS

PUNCT O

the O
baterry S-POS
is O
very O
longer O
PUNCT O

and O
it O
's O
so O
quiet O
that O
i O
do O
n't O
hear O
it O
at O
all O
PUNCT O

its O
size S-POS
is O
ideal O
and O
the O
weight S-POS
is O
acceptable O
PUNCT O

i O
know O
apples O
are O
more O
expensive O
than O
pcs O
PUNCT O
but O
he O
thinks O
it O
is O
worth O
every O
penny O
PUNCT O

to O
me O
it O
's O
a O
workhorse O
and O
quiet O
as O
can O
be O
you O
even O
save O
big O
bucks O
not O
dishing O
out O
any O
extra O
to O
uncle O
sam O
definite O
buy O
PUNCT O

i O
can O
say O
that O
i O
am O
fully O
satisfied O
with O
the O
performance S-POS
that O
the O
computer O
has O
supplied O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
pretty O
sure O
when O
i O
bought O
it O
PUNCT O
my O
bank O

went O
ouch O
PUNCT O

thank O
you O
so O
much O
for O
the O
great O
item O
PUNCT O

this O
laptop O
has O
only O
2 O
usb B-NEG
ports E-NEG
PUNCT O
and O
they O
are O
both O
on O
the O
same O
side O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
annoying O
very O
much O
and O
i O
wo O
n't O
ever O
buy O
any O
acer O
products O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
why O
i O
purchased O
a O
brand O
new O
laptop O
in O
the O
first O
place O
so O
it O
would O
n't O
have O
any O
problems O
PUNCT O

it O
has O
so O
much O
more O
speed S-POS
and O
the O
screen S-POS
is O
very O
sharp O
PUNCT O

as O
for O
the O
laptop O
PUNCT O
this O
is O
our O
3rd O
apple O
computer O
in O
the O
past O
2 O
years O
PUNCT O

everything O
i O
wanted O
and O
everything O
i O
needed O
and O
the O
price S-POS
was O
great O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
not O
inexpensive O
but O
the O
hardware B-POS
performance E-POS
is O
impressive O
for O
a O
computer O
this O
small O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
better O
than O
my O
old O
acer O
laptop O
PUNCT O

this O
thing O
is O
awesome O
PUNCT O
everything O
always O
works S-POS
PUNCT O
everything O
is O
always O
easy O
to O
set B-POS
up E-POS
PUNCT O
everything O
is O
compatible O
PUNCT O
its O
literally O
everything O
i O
could O
ask O
for O
PUNCT O

i O
would O
buy O
it O
again O
in O
a O
heartbeat O
PUNCT O

keyboard S-POS
responds O
well O
to O
presses O
PUNCT O

if O
someone O
called O
me O
an O
apple O
fanboyit O
would O
make O
sense O
PUNCT O

lastly O
PUNCT O
windows B-NEG
8 E-NEG
is O
annoying O
PUNCT O

a O
scratch O
on O
a O
PUNCT O
1,500 O

is O
unforgivable O
PUNCT O

i O
just O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
this O
thing O
PUNCT O

everything O
is O
so O
easy O
and O
intuitive O
to O
setup S-POS
or O
configure S-POS
PUNCT O

i O
have O
no O
problems O
yet O
on O
my O

so O
far O
PUNCT O
and O
hope O
it O
stays O
like O
that O
PUNCT O

this O
laptop O
is O
a O
great O
buy O
PUNCT O

biggest O
complaint O
is O
windows B-NEG

PUNCT O

only O
2 O

kind O
oflimited O
PUNCT O

it O
has O
been O
to O
early O
to O
see O
if O
this O

the O

or O
not O
though O
PUNCT O

this O
device O
has O
met O
my O
expectations O
and O
i O
'm O
sure O
it O
will O
meet O

never O

has O
any O

PUNCT O

out O

noticed O
how O

exactly O
what O
i O

PUNCT O

the O

i O
was O
extremely O
happy O
with O

i O
was O
looking O
for O
something O
in O
between O
a O

a O

this O
is O
it O
PUNCT O

the O

gives O
us O
confidence O
that O

waned O

'd O
be O
the O

to O
recommend O

PUNCT O

i O
would O
have O
given O

PUNCT O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

the O
price O
is O
higher O
than O
most O
lab O

out O
there O
PUNCT O
however O
PUNCT O
he/she O

which O
is O
a O
great O
computer O
PUNCT O

give O

a O
try O
PUNCT O

set B-POS

was O
a O
breeze O
PUNCT O

but O
i O

win8 S-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
have O
owned O
at O
least O
4 O
to O
5 O
laptops O
and O
computers O
PUNCT O
but O
this O
is O
by O
far O
the O
most O
superior O
machine O
i O
have O
ever O
owned O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
still O
in O
the O
process O
of O
learning O
about O
its O
features S-NEU
PUNCT O

btw O
PUNCT O
i O
checked O
online O
regarding O
the O
old O
laptop O
that O
died O
and O
found O
that O
i O
was O
not O
alone O
PUNCT O
far O
from O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
had O
the O
same O
reasons O
as O
most O
pc O
users O
PUNCT O
the O
price S-NEG
PUNCT O
the O
overbearing O
restrictions O
of O
osx S-NEG
and O
lack O
of O
support B-NEG
for I-NEG
games E-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
wanted O
it O
for O
it O
's O
mobility S-POS
and O
man O
PUNCT O
this O
little O
bad O
boy O
is O
very O
nice O
PUNCT O

seems O
to O
me O
that O
's O
the O
best O
way O
to O
get O
apple O
's O
attention O
PUNCT O

very O
nice O
so O
far O
PUNCT O

you O
wo O
n't O
be O
disappointed O
PUNCT O

the O
investment O
of O
a O
new O
macbook O
pro O
came O
at O
a O
price O
PUNCT O
but O
totally O
worth O
it O
for O
a O
good O
piece O
of O
mind O
PUNCT O

i O
found O
the O
mini O
to O
be O
PUNCT O
exceptionally O
easy O
to O
set B-POS
up E-POS

having O
usb3 S-POS
is O
why O
i O
bought O
this O
mini O
PUNCT O

be O
sure O
to O
have O
good O
air O
flow O
where O
ever O
you O
put O
it O
PUNCT O

the O
sound S-POS
is O
nice O
and O
loud O
PUNCT O
i O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
problems O
with O
hearing O
anything O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
very O
slim O
PUNCT O
the O
track B-POS
pad E-POS
is O
very O
much O
impressed O
with O
me O
PUNCT O

this O
was O
the O
same O
problem O
with O
my O
macbook O
circa O
2007 O
that O
i O
just O
retired O
PUNCT O

great O
things O
come O
in O
small O
packages O
PUNCT O

huge O
apple O
mac O
fan O
PUNCT O

looked O
at O
hp O
PUNCT O
asus O
PUNCT O
acer O
PUNCT O
sony O
and O
a O
bunch O
of O
other O
ones O
but O
could O
not O
find O
i O
really O
liked O
PUNCT O

the O
settings S-NEG
are O
not O
user-friendly O
either O
PUNCT O

honestly O
PUNCT O
i O
am O
surprised O
no O
one O
else O
has O
mentioned O
returning O
theirs O
PUNCT O

most O
of O
them O
were O
either O
too O
big O
PUNCT O
too O
noisy O
and O
too O
slow O
after O
2 O
years O
PUNCT O

the O
machine O
is O
used O
PUNCT O
but O
is O
like O
new O
PUNCT O
i O
'm O
very O
impress O
PUNCT O

thank O
goodness O
for O
openoffice S-POS
PUNCT O

awesome O

PUNCT O
great O
battery B-POS
life E-POS
PUNCT O
wonderful O
ux S-POS
PUNCT O

needless O
to O
say O
PUNCT O
the O
leap O
from O
that O
to O
this O
has O
been O
amazing O
and O
aside O
from O
the O
financial O
reasons O
i O
am O
astounded O
that O
i O
had O
n't O
made O
the O
switch O
sooner O
PUNCT O

its O
perfect O
PUNCT O
not O
much O
heavy O
PUNCT O

i O
love O
the O
keyboard S-POS
and O
the O
screen S-POS
PUNCT O

i O
find O
it O
not O
to O
be O
very O
user O
friendly O
PUNCT O

it O
has O
surpassed O
all O
expectations O
and O
fulfilled O
all O
my O
needs O
PUNCT O

however O
PUNCT O
there O
are O
major O
issues O
with O
the O
touchpad S-NEG
which O
render O
the O
device O
nearly O
useless O
PUNCT O

what O
angers O
me O
more O
than O
anything O
else O
is O
that O
i O
spent O
all O
those O
years O
hating O
macs O
when O
i O
could O
have O
been O
getting O
a O
lot O
more O
production O
with O
a O
whole O
lot O
less O
grief O
PUNCT O

i O
've O
already O
upgraded O
o O
mavericks S-POS
and O
i O
am O
impressed O
with O
everything O
about O
this O
computer O
PUNCT O

so O
this O
is O
very O
good O
commputer O
and O
i O
highly O
suggest O
it O
PUNCT O

the O
mbp O
i O
recieved O
was O
everything O
it O
should O
have O
been O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
going O
to O
buy O
today O
and O
noticed O
it O
went O
back O
up O
to O
PUNCT O

PUNCT O
PUNCT O

not O
as O
fast O
as O
i O
would O
have O
expect O
for O
an O
i5 S-NEG
PUNCT O

so O
of O
course O
this O
one O
came O
through O
with O
the O
awesomeness O
PUNCT O

you O
will O
not O
regret O
buying O
this O
computer O
PUNCT O

nothing O
bad O
to O
say O
about O
it O
PUNCT O

it O
s O
heavy O
for O
mac O
book O
but O
is O
good O
PUNCT O

thanks O
for O
great O
service S-POS
and O
shipping S-POS
PUNCT O

deal O
of O
the O
year O
PUNCT O

my O
sisters O
same O
laptop O
broke O
about O
the O
month O
later O
for O
the O
same O
reason O
PUNCT O

minis O
make O
sense O
for O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
PUNCT O

the O
performance S-POS
seems O
quite O
good O
PUNCT O
and O
built-in B-POS
applications E-POS
like O
iphoto S-POS
work O
great O
with O
my O
phone O
and O
camera O
PUNCT O

this O
mac O
mini O
makes O
the O
macbook O
pro O
seem O
slow O
PUNCT O

i O
did O
swap O
out O
the O
hard B-NEU
drive E-NEU
for O
a O
samsung B-POS
830 I-POS
ssd E-POS
which O
i O
highly O
recommend O
PUNCT O

i O
bought O
this O
macbook O
pro O
to O
replace O
my O
six-year-old O
pc O
a O
sony O
vaio O
PUNCT O
but O
it O
was O
basically O
no O
better O
than O
my O
old O
pc O
PUNCT O
so O
i O
returned O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
wanted O
a O
simple O
PUNCT O
reliable O
laptop O
PUNCT O

cheaper O
than O
buying O
it O
PUNCT O
apple O
too O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
just O
had O
to O
learn O
to O
be O
a O
little O
harder O
typer O
than O
on O
my O
last O
computer O
PUNCT O

extremely O
disappointed O
with O
the O
way O
it O
is O
PUNCT O

never O
been O
happier O
using O
computer O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
had O
a O
total O
of O
5 O
different O
laptop O
from O
many O
different O
manufactures O
PUNCT O

does O
everything O
i O
wanted O
this O
laptop O
to O
do O
PUNCT O

besides O
PUNCT O
the O
apple O
stocks O
have O
been O
falling O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
sales O
PUNCT O

turns O
out O
this O
is O
a O
common O
problem O
PUNCT O

starts B-POS
up E-POS
in O
a O
hurry O
and O
everything O
is O
ready O
to O
go O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
also O
fast O
as O
can O
be O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
well O
worth O
the O
investment O
PUNCT O

but O
i O
'm O
still O
learning O
so O
ca O
n't O
rate O
it O
yet O
for O
everything O
PUNCT O

overall O
very O
impressed O
PUNCT O
thank O
you O
apple O
and O
amazon O
PUNCT O

yes O
PUNCT O
that O
's O
a O
good O
thing O
PUNCT O
but O
it O
's O
made O
from O
aluminum S-NEG
that O
scratches O
easily O
PUNCT O

very O
fast O
for O
my O
needs O
PUNCT O

i O
bought O
this O
mac O
in O
order O
to O
replace O
my O
old O
dell O
laptop O
PUNCT O

quick O
and O
has O
built B-POS
in I-POS
virus I-POS
control E-POS
PUNCT O

took O
a O
long O
time O
trying O
to O
decide O
between O
one O
with O
retina B-NEU
display E-NEU
and O
one O
without O
PUNCT O

i O
saw O
the O
mini O
mac O
at O
best O
buy O
and O
decided O
to O
get O
this O
as O
my O
replacement O
PUNCT O

i O
finally O
decided O
on O
this O
one O
and O
could O
n't O
be O
any O
happier O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
also O
informed O
that O
the O
components S-NEG
of O
the O
mac O
book O
were O
dirty O
PUNCT O

so O
glad O
i O
did O
not O
waste O
money O
on O
a O
less O
than O
par O
product O
PUNCT O

have O
n't O
regretted O
it O
one O
bit O
PUNCT O

the O
one O
thing O
that O
apple O
does O
right O
is O
computers O
PUNCT O

the O
hardware S-NEG
problems O
have O
been O
so O
bad O
PUNCT O
i O
ca O
n't O
wait O
till O
it O
completely O
dies O
in O
3 O
years O
PUNCT O
tops O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
so O
nice O
that O
the O
battery S-POS
last O
so O
long O
and O
that O
this O
machine O
has O
the O
snow B-POS
lion E-POS
PUNCT O

i O
think O
that O
they O
are O
the O
best O
out O
on O
the O
market O
PUNCT O

however O
i O
chose O
two O
day O
shipping S-NEG
and O
it O
took O
over O
a O
week O
to O
arrive O
PUNCT O

that O
's O
quite O
a O
bump O
up O
from O
the O
PUNCT O
599 O
that O
this O
little O
guy O
sells O
for O
PUNCT O
which O
leaves O
me O
to O
my O
next O
point O
PUNCT O

this O
is O
quite O
smooth O
as O
well O
as O
heavy O
and O
can O
easily O
slip O
through O
the O
hands O
PUNCT O

my O
laptop O
is O
so O
light O
that O
i O
can O
take O
it O
with O
me O
anywhere O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
exactly O
what O
i O
wanted O
PUNCT O
and O
it O
has O
all O
the O
new O
features S-POS
and O
whatnot O
PUNCT O

you O
can O
do O
absolutely O
anything O
and O
is O
very O
fast O
and O
stylish O
PUNCT O

finally O
decided O
to O
try O
a O
mac O
because O
there O
were O
too O
many O
choices O
of O
which O
pc O
's O
to O
buy O
and O
everyone O
who O
had O
a O
mac O
said O
buy O
a O
mac O
PUNCT O

can O
you O
buy O
any O
laptop O
that O
matches O
the O
quality S-POS
of O
a O
macbook O
PUNCT O

it O
feels O
cheap O
PUNCT O
the O
keyboard S-NEG
is O
not O
very O
sensitive O
PUNCT O

that O
defeated O
the O
whole O
point O
of O
a O
laptop O
PUNCT O

though O
please O
note O
that O
sometimes O
it O
crashes O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
sound B-NEG
quality E-NEG
isnt O
superb O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
navigate S-POS
even O
for O
a O
novice O
PUNCT O

but O
until O
now O
PUNCT O
no O
complains O
at O
all O
PUNCT O

the O
cons O
are O
more O
annoyances O
that O
can O
be O
lived O
with O
PUNCT O

does O
everything O
i O
need O
it O
to O
PUNCT O

a O
wonderful O

and O
i O
could O
n't O
be O
happier O
PUNCT O

great O
performance S-POS
and O
quality S-POS
PUNCT O

just O
what O
i O
needed O
for O
portable O
and O
my O

PUNCT O

the O

the O

PUNCT O

it O
's O
just O
what O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
and O
it O
works S-POS
great O
PUNCT O

having O
a O
mac O
certainly O
makes O
life O
easier O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
so O
quick O
and O
responsive O
that O
it O
makes O
working S-POS
on O
a O
computer O
so O
much O
more O
pleasurable O
PUNCT O

the O
old O
unibody O
macbook O
pro O
could O
fry O
an O
egg O
after O
a O
while O
PUNCT O

it O
works S-POS
fine O
PUNCT O
and O
all O
the O
software S-POS
seems O
to O
run O
pretty O
well O
PUNCT O

for O
this O
purpose O
PUNCT O
it O
's O
great O
PUNCT O

could O
n't O
have O
asked O
for O
more O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
using O
this O
computer O
for O
word B-NEU
processing E-NEU
PUNCT O
web B-NEU
browsing E-NEU
PUNCT O
some O
gaming S-NEU
PUNCT O
and O
i O
'm O
learning O

PUNCT O

it O
certainly O
does O
PUNCT O
but O
you O
rarely O
hear O
any O
of O
your O
friends O
with O
mac O

complain O
about O
anything O
PUNCT O

my O
wife O
was O
so O
excited O
to O
open O
the O
box O
PUNCT O
but O
quickly O
came O
to O
see O
that O
it O
did O
not O
function S-NEG
as O
it O
should O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
technical O
pearls O
to O
share O
PUNCT O

i O
wanted O
a O
computer O
that O
was O
quite O
PUNCT O
fast O
PUNCT O
and O
that O
had O
overall O
great O
performance S-NEU
PUNCT O

apple B-NEG
"help" E-NEG
is O
a O
mixed O
bag O
PUNCT O

all O
i O
can O
say O
is O
i O
am O
impressed O
PUNCT O

it O
suddenly O
can O
not O
work S-NEG
PUNCT O

it O
did O
everything O
we O
expected O
PUNCT O

harddrive S-NEG
was O
in O
poor O
condition O
PUNCT O
had O
to O
replace O
it O
PUNCT O

the O
on/off B-NEG
switch E-NEG
is O
a O
bit O
obscure O
in O
the O
rear O
corner O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
a O
nice O
little O
gadget O
PUNCT O

my O
only O
complaint O
is O
the O
total O
lack O
of O
instructions S-NEG
that O
come O
with O
the O
mac O
mini O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
task O
that O
this O
computer O
would O
not O
be O
good O
enough O
for O
would O
be O
gaming S-NEG
PUNCT O
otherwise O
the O
integrated O

work O
well O
for O
other O
tasks O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
macbook O

and O
there O
is O
no O
discusion O
about O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
hoping O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
features O
will O
be O
the O
signature O
quality O
of O
apple O
PUNCT O

i O
use O
it O
mostly O
for O
content B-POS
creation I-POS
audio E-POS
PUNCT O
video S-POS
PUNCT O
photo B-POS
editing E-POS
and O
its O
reliable O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
the O
best O
all O
around O
mac O
PUNCT O

screen S-POS
is O
bright O
and O
gorgeous O
PUNCT O

also O
is O
portable O
and O
reliable O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
solution O
is O
to O
turn O
the O
brightness S-NEU
down O
PUNCT O
etc O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
not O
an O
easy O
decision O
to O
purchase O
a O
used O
or O
even O
good O
as O
new O
laptop O
but O
i O
am O
very O
satisfied O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
want O
more O
information O
on O

i O
suggest O
going O
to O
applecom O

heading O
towards O
the O

for O
more O
information O
on O
the O

okay O
PUNCT O
it O

incredibly O
fast O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
fast O
and O
easy O
to O
use S-POS
PUNCT O

this O
was O
absolutely O
annoying O
PUNCT O

and O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
comes O
with O
an O
i5 B-POS
processor E-POS
definitely O
speeds O
things O
up O

but O
for O
those O
of O
you O
that O

have O
a O

this O

is O
intuitive O

its O
built B-POS

so O
happy O
i O

let O
me O
start O
off O

that O

highly O

the O

was O
great O

i O
went O
from O

this O
was O
a O

web B-POS

is O
very O
quick O
with O

browser E-POS
PUNCT O

it O
could O
n't O
have O
been O
a O
better O
decision O
PUNCT O

i O
like O
the O
lighted B-POS
screen E-POS
at O
night O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
great O
to O
have O
a O
solid O

it O

noticably O
less O
expensive O
than O
the O

ones O
PUNCT O

this O
can O
be O
annoying O
at O
first O
but O
you O
just O
have O
to O
train O
yourself O
not O
to O
to O
start O
over O
so O
far O
PUNCT O

and O
mine O
had O

i O
am O
not O
happy O
with O
my O

it O

fast O
PUNCT O
light O
PUNCT O
and O
is O
perfect O
for O
media B-POS
editing E-POS
PUNCT O
which O
is O
mostly O
why O
i O
bought O
it O
in O
the O
first O
place O
PUNCT O

however O
PUNCT O
the O
machine O
itself O
left O
a O
bit O
to O
be O
desired O
PUNCT O

the O
battery S-POS
lasts O
as O
advertised O
give O
or O
take O
15-20 O
minutes O
PUNCT O
and O
the O
entire O
user B-POS
experience E-POS
is O
very O
elegant O
PUNCT O

i O
spent O
months O
looking O
for O
a O
good O

i O
finally O
found O

PUNCT O

the O
smaller O

was O
a O
bonus O
because O
of O
space O
restrictions O
PUNCT O

i O
blame O
the O
mac B-NEG
os E-NEG
PUNCT O

but O
for O
now O
PUNCT O
this O
laptop O
is O
still O
a O
workhorse O

PUNCT O

PUNCT O

i O
like O
the O

PUNCT O

i O
wish O
i O
would O
have O
taken O
the O

years O

PUNCT O

i O
love O
the O

factor E-POS
PUNCT O

i O
have O
n't O
used O
the O

long O
enough O
to O
write O
a O
detailed O
technical O
review O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
fast O
at O
loading B-POS
the I-POS

so O
much O
faster O

sleeker O
looking S-POS
PUNCT O

i O
plan O
on O
using O
my O

for O
a O

PUNCT O

unfortunately O
PUNCT O
it O
runs O

pretty O
easy O
to O
get O
around O

is O
great O
eg O
the O

is O
one O
of O
the O
best O

exactly O
what O

a O
terribly O

PUNCT O

i O
love O

will O
be O
hard O
to O
go O
back O
to O

after O
using O
a O
macbook O

PUNCT O

very O
nice O
unibody B-POS

with O
apple O

have O
a O

i O

perfectly O
PUNCT O

this O

is O
a-mazing O
PUNCT O

it O
should O

that O
PUNCT O
i O
do O

have O
any O

anything O
PUNCT O

my O

like O
my O
friendsit O
did O
last O
him O
5 O
good O
years O
before O
it O
bit O
the O

PUNCT O

considering O
another O

out O

the O
question O

it O
looks S-POS
and O
feels S-POS
solid O
PUNCT O
with O
a O
flawless O
finish S-POS
PUNCT O

its O
worth O
every O
penny O
PUNCT O

price S-NEG
was O
higher O
when O

when O

to O
price S-POS
showing O

when O
i O
bought O
this O
product O
PUNCT O

this O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
for O
a O

out O
macbook O

then O
the O
system S-NEG
would O
many O
times O
not O
power B-NEG
down E-NEG
without O
a O
forced O
power-off O
PUNCT O

get O
this O
instead O
PUNCT O
you O
wo O
n't O
be O
sorry O
PUNCT O

the O
configuration S-POS

perfect O
for O
my O

the O
worst O

PUNCT O

i O
think O

16 O
hundred O

last O
i O
checked O

the O

PUNCT O

apple O

really O
settling O
into O
the O
college O
life O
PUNCT O
i O
found O
myself O
wanting O
something O
smaller O
and O
less O
cumbersome O
PUNCT O
not O
to O
mention O
that O
the O
asus O
had O
been O
slowly O
developing O
problems O
ever O
since O
i O
bought O
it O
about O
4 O

PUNCT O

however O
PUNCT O
it O
did O
not O
have O
any O
scratches O
PUNCT O
zero O
battery B-POS
cycle I-POS
count E-POS
pretty O
surprised O
PUNCT O
and O
all O
the O
hardware S-POS
seemed O
to O
be O
working O
perfectly O
PUNCT O

after O
fumbling O
around O
with O
the O
os S-NEG
i O
started O
searching O
the O
internet O
for O
a O
fix O
and O
found O
a O
number O
of O
forums O
on O
fixing O
the O
issue O
PUNCT O

i O
could O
n't O
be O
more O
pleased O
PUNCT O

and O
as O
for O
all O
the O
fancy O
finger B-NEG
swipes E-NEG
PUNCT O
i O
just O
gave O
up O
and O
attached O
a O

PUNCT O

i O
needed O
a O
laptop O
with O
big O
storage S-NEU
PUNCT O
a O
nice O

and O
fast O
so O
i O
can O
photoshop S-NEU
without O
any O
problem O
PUNCT O

i O
like O
coming O
back O
to O
mac B-POS
os E-POS
but O
this O
laptop O
is O
lacking O
in O
speaker B-NEG
quality E-NEG
compared O
to O
my O
PUNCT O
400 O
old O

laptop O
PUNCT O

it O
is O
much O
better O
than O
the O
acer O

i O
had O
before O
PUNCT O

shipped S-POS
very O
quickly O
and O
safely O
PUNCT O

i O
finally O
own O
a O
piece O
of O

equipment O
that O
i O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
take O
a O

PUNCT O

the O

is O
awesome O
PUNCT O

PUNCT O
fast O

PUNCT O

the O

definitely O
superior O
to O
any O

i O
've O
ever O
put O
my O

on O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
great O
for O
streaming B-POS
video E-POS
and O
other O

uses E-POS
PUNCT O

apple O
did O
a O
great O
job O
PUNCT O

i O
like O
the O
design S-POS
and O
its O
features S-POS
but O
there O
are O
somethings O
i O
think O
needs O
to O
be O
improved O
PUNCT O

there O
were O
small O
problems O
with O
mac B-NEG
office E-NEG
PUNCT O

it O
is O
extremely O
fast O
and O
very O
compact O
PUNCT O

i O
understand O
i O
should O
call O
apple B-NEU
tech I-NEU
support E-NEU
about O
any O
variableswhich O
is O
my O
purpose O
of O
writing O
this O
con O
as O
variables O
could O
be O
a O
bigger O
future O
problem O
PUNCT O

i O
ordered O
my O
2012 O
mac O
mini O
after O
being O
disappointed O
with O
spec S-NEG
of O
the O
new O
27 O
imacs O
PUNCT O

it O
still O
works S-POS
and O
it O
's O
extremely O
user O
friendly O
PUNCT O
so O
i O
would O
recommend O
it O
for O
new O
computer O
user O
and O
also O
for O
those O
who O
are O
just O
looking O
for O
a O
more O
efficient O
way O
to O
do O
things O

its O
fast O
PUNCT O
easy O
to O
use S-POS
and O
it O
looks S-POS
great O
PUNCT O

but O
office S-NEU
can O
be O
purchased O
if O
i O
ever O
need O
a O
laptop O
again O
i O
am O
for O
sure O
purchasing O
another O
toshiba O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
n't O
tried O
the O
one O
with O

maybe O
in O
the O
future O
PUNCT O

you O
can O
read O
all O
about O
the O
details O
of O
this O
marvelous O
computer O
on O
wikipedia O
PUNCT O

performance S-POS
is O
much O
much O
better O
on O
the O
pro O
PUNCT O
especially O
if O
you O
install O
an O
ssd S-POS
on O
it O
PUNCT O

note O
PUNCT O
however O
PUNCT O
that O
any O
existing O
magsafe B-NEU
accessories E-NEU
you O
have O
will O
not O
work O
with O
the O
magsafe B-NEG

connection E-NEG
PUNCT O

if O
you O
get O
a O
lemon O
i O
have O
two O
thirds O
of O
my O
macs O
PUNCT O
you O
have O
to O
send O
it O
in O
for O
repairs O
several O
times O
before O
they O
will O
replace O
it O
PUNCT O
even O
if O
they O
have O
numerous O
problems O
with O
the O
same O
version O
of O
their O
computers O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
dislike O
is O
the O
touchpad S-NEG
PUNCT O
alot O
of O
the O
times O
its O
unresponsive O
and O
does O
things O
i O
do O
n't O
want O
it O
too O
PUNCT O
i O
would O
recommend O
using O
a O
mouse S-NEU
with O
it O
PUNCT O

yeah O
PUNCT O
it O
's O
super O
expensive O
PUNCT O

the O
mac O
mini O
is O
about O
8x O
smaller O
than O
my O
old O
computer O
which O
is O
a O
huge O
bonus O
and O
runs S-POS
very O
quiet O
PUNCT O
actually O
the O
fans S-POS
are O
n't O
audible O
unlike O
my O
old O
pc O

maybe O
the O
mac B-NEG
os E-NEG
improvement O
were O
not O
the O
product O
they O
want O
to O
offer O
PUNCT O

it O
came O
before O
the O
day O
it O
supposed O
to O
which O
is O
great O
PUNCT O

i O
thought O
the O
transition O
would O
be O
difficult O
at O
best O
and O
would O
take O
some O
time O
to O
fully O
familiarize O
myself O
with O
the O
new O
mac B-NEU
ecosystem E-NEU
PUNCT O

it O
's O
absolutely O
wonderful O
and O
worth O
the O
price S-POS
PUNCT O

it O
's O
a O
good O
fix O
PUNCT O
in O
my O
opinion O
PUNCT O

i O
am O
please O
with O
the O

ease O
of O

PUNCT O
out O
of O
the O
box O
ready O
PUNCT O
appearance S-POS
and O

PUNCT O

buying O
a O
mac O

would O
allow O
me O
to O
make O
the O
transition O
PUNCT O

before O
i O
begin O
PUNCT O
i O
will O
say O
that O
i O
am O
not O
like O
a O
good O
percentage O
of O
the O
people O
that O
will O
end O
up O
writing O
a O
review O
on O
this O
computer O
PUNCT O
i O
am O
not O
an O
apple O
fanboy O
PUNCT O

its O
by O
far O
faster O
and O
more O
stable O
then O
my O
pc O
PUNCT O

i O
purchased O
a O

this O
to O
replace O
a O

i O

you O
will O
not O

it O
PUNCT O
promise O
you O
PUNCT O

moving O

never O

PUNCT O
everything O

PUNCT O

they O

PUNCT O

it O
was O
at O
my O
door O
in O
less O
than O
24 O
hours O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
also O
very O
pricey O
but O
you O
just O
have O
to O
tell O
yourself O
it O
's O
an O
investment O
and O
that O
it O
's O
gon O

it O
is O
pretty O

which O
is O
good O
enough O
for O

this O

PUNCT O

the O

is O
a O
great O
product O
which O
can O
meet O
the O
needs O
of O
the O
average O
consumer O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
concerned O
that O
the O
downgrade O
to O
the O
regular B-POS
hard I-POS
drive E-POS
would O
make O
it O
unacceptably O
slow O
but O
i O
need O
not O
have O
worried O
PUNCT O
this O
machine O
is O
the O
fastest O
i O
have O
ever O

PUNCT O

this O
one O
still O

the O

PUNCT O

no O

PUNCT O

i O
had O
to O
install B-NEG
mountain I-NEG

and O
it O
took O
a O
good O
two O
hours O
PUNCT O

customization S-NEG
on O

is O
impossible O
PUNCT O

i O
hope O
this O
review O
helps O
PUNCT O

however O
PUNCT O
you O
have O
to O
adjust O
yourself O
to O
what O
it O
will O
do O
PUNCT O
not O
what O
you O
want O
it O
to O

PUNCT O

i O
am O
replacing O
the O

a O

soon O
PUNCT O

plus O
two B-POS
finger I-POS
clicking E-POS
as O
a O
replacement O
for O
the O
right B-NEU
click I-NEU

is O
surprisingly O
intuitive O
PUNCT O

far O
superior O
to O
my O
macbook O
PUNCT O

the O
superdrive S-POS
is O
quiet O
PUNCT O

it O
was O
quite O
easy O
PUNCT O

the O
power B-NEG
plug E-NEG
has O
to O
be O
connected O
to O
the O
power B-NEU
adaptor E-NEU
to O
charge O
the O
battery S-NEU
but O
wo O
n't O
stay O
connected O
PUNCT O

i O
decided O
to O
buy O
a O
few O
notebooks O
for O
my O
nephews O
for O
xmas O
PUNCT O

the O
battery S-NEG
was O
completely O
dead O
PUNCT O
in O
fact O
it O
had O
grown O
about O
a O
quarter O
inch O
thick O
lump O
on O
the O

PUNCT O

this O
is O
no O
exception O
PUNCT O

if O
yo O
like O
practicality S-POS
this O
is O
the O
laptop O
for O
you O
PUNCT O

the O
os S-POS
is O
great O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
had O
a O
black O
macbook O
since O
2007 O
PUNCT O

i O
tried O
several O

several O

this O
was O
the O

each O
time O
PUNCT O

cons O
PUNCT O

is O
a O
bit O
ridiculous O
PUNCT O
kinda O
heavy O
PUNCT O

if O
that O
is O
the O

PUNCT O
then O
i O
am O
completely O
happy O

10/10 O
five O
stars O
would O
recommend O
PUNCT O

the O
troubleshooting O
said O
it O
was O
the O

so O
we O
ordered O
a O
new O
one O

i O
fell O

PUNCT O

no O

that O

be O
my O
fault O
PUNCT O

there O
is O
no O
"tools" B-NEU

PUNCT O

it O
is O
very O

everything O
that O
i O
need O
except O
for O
a O
word B-NEG
program E-NEG
PUNCT O

needs O
a O
cd/dvd B-NEU
drive E-NEU
and O
a O
bigger O

it O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

the O

exactly O

PUNCT O

its O
everything O

PUNCT O

nice O

PUNCT O

besides O
being O
elegant O
PUNCT O
the O

PUNCT O

i O
switched O

i O
wanted O
something O

PUNCT O
even O
though O
i O
miss O

PUNCT O

yes O
PUNCT O
the O

PUNCT O

apple O
no O
longer O
includes O

and O
furthermore O
PUNCT O
apple O
does O

even O
offer O
it O
anymore O
PUNCT O

i O
also O
wanted O
windows B-POS
7 E-POS
PUNCT O
which O
this O
one O
has O
PUNCT O

at O
first O
PUNCT O
i O
feel O
a O
little O
bit O
uncomfortable O
in O
using O
the O
mac B-NEG
system E-NEG
PUNCT O

i O
am O
used O
to O

with O

so O
i O
am O
having O
a O
little O
difficulty O
finding O
my O
way O
around O
PUNCT O

they O
replaced O
it O
and O
so O
far O
so O
good O
PUNCT O

it O
just O
works S-POS
out O
of O
the O
box O
and O
you O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
cool O
software S-POS
included O
with O
the O

PUNCT O

good O
in O
every O
aspect O
PUNCT O

its O
as O
advertised O
on O
here O
it O
works S-POS
great O
and O
is O
not O
a O
waste O
of O
money O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

replaced O
this O
one O
with O
my O
mac O
that O
was O
stolen O
PUNCT O
its O
a O
great O
computer O
PUNCT O

just O
be O
careful O
PUNCT O
you O
always O
have O
to O
give O
up O
some O
good O
stuff O
for O
others O
PUNCT O

runs S-POS
like O
a O
champ O
PUNCT O

really O
greatwell O
let O
me O
start O
at O
the O
beginning O
PUNCT O

premium O
price S-POS
for O
the O
os S-NEU
more O
than O
anything O
else O
PUNCT O

this O
was O
a O
gift O
for O
my O
grand O
son O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
a O
little O
concerned O
about O
the O
touch B-POS
pad E-POS
based O
on O
reviews O
PUNCT O
but O
i O
've O
found O
it O
fine O
to O
work O
with O
PUNCT O

i O
bought O
this O
mac O
book O
pro O
along O
with O
a O
new O
27 O
imac O
and O
while O
they O
are O
still O
light O
years O
more O
reliable O
than O
a O
pc O
i O
have O
noticed O
a O
decline O
in O
the O
reliability O
of O
my O
mac O
computers O
PUNCT O

the O
sound O
as O
mentioned O
earlier O
is O
n't O
the O
best O
PUNCT O
but O
it O
can O
be O
solved O
with O
headphones S-NEU
PUNCT O

the O
track O
pad O
is O
a O
bit O
squirrely O
at O
times O
sometimes O
too O
sensitive O
PUNCT O
and O
sometimes O
a O
bit O
unresponsive O
PUNCT O
but O
it O
's O
usable O
PUNCT O

however O
PUNCT O
the O
experience O
was O
great O
since O
the O
os S-POS
does O
not O
become O
unstable O
and O
the O
application S-POS
will O
simply O
shutdown O
and O
reopen O
PUNCT O

then O
only O
four O
months O
later O
PUNCT O
my O
great O
macbook O
pro O
failed O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
ask O
me O
PUNCT O
for O
this O
price S-NEG
it O
should O
be O
included O
PUNCT O

the O
battery S-NEG
is O
not O
as O
shown O
in O
the O
product O
photos O
PUNCT O

even O
though O
i O
could O
have O
gotten O
a O
pc O
twice O
the O
speed O
for O
the O
same O
price O
i O
still O
think O
there O
's O
nothing O
like O
a O
mac O
PUNCT O

seems O
a O
much O
more O
economical O
way O
to O
get O
into O
apple O
than O
their O
other O
computers O
PUNCT O

shipping S-POS
was O
quick O
and O
product O
described O
was O
the O
product O
sent O
and O
so O
much O
more O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
so O
disgusted O
that O
i O
wasted O
my O
money O
on O
this O
product O
PUNCT O

all O
you O
get O
is O
a O
box O
and O
a O
computer O
PUNCT O

the O

its O
only O

one O
time O
in O
the O
3 O

i O
've O
had O
it O
PUNCT O

the O
mac O
mini O
is O
probably O
the O
simplest O
example O
of O
compact B-POS
computing E-POS
out O
there O
PUNCT O

instead O
PUNCT O
i O
'll O
focus O

many O

complain O
about O

it O
's O
urgent O
for O

now O
that O
i O

i O

PUNCT O

the O

4mb O
PUNCT O

was O
debating O
to O
buy O
one O
for O
months O
PUNCT O
checked O
out O
different O
stuff O
on O
youtube O
PUNCT O
and O
read O
different O
articles O
and O
debates O
PUNCT O
i O
just O
did O
n't O
really O
wan O
na O
spend O
the O
money O
but O
im O
glad O
that O
i O
did O
PUNCT O

i O
love O
it O
and O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
everyone O
who O
is O
tired O
of O
the O
constant O
attention O
pc O
's O
require O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
a O
little O
worry O
at O
first O
because O
i O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
experience O
with O
os.x S-NEU
and O
windows S-POS
has O
always O
been O
second O
nature O
to O
me O
after O
many O
years O
of O
using O
windows S-POS
PUNCT O

i O
am O
an O
info O
sys O
major O
in O
college O
PUNCT O
so O
i O
started O
researching O
this O
issue O
on O
my O
own O
PUNCT O

solution O
PUNCT O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
pretty O
simple O
PUNCT O

with O
the O
softwares S-NEU
supporting O
the O
use O
of O
other O
os S-NEU
makes O
it O
much O
better O
PUNCT O

still O
have O
n't O
solved O
this O
PUNCT O

i O
then O
upgraded O
to O
mac B-NEU
os I-NEU
x I-NEU
10.8 I-NEU
"mountain I-NEU
lion" E-NEU
PUNCT O

it O
is O
extremely O
fast O
and O
never O
lags O
PUNCT O

i O
told O
them O
that O
i O
just O
received O
my O
brand O
new O
macbook O
but O
i O
was O
having O
issues O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
considering O
buying O
the O
air O
PUNCT O
but O
in O
reality O
PUNCT O
this O
one O
has O
a O
more O
powerful O
performance S-POS
and O
seems O
much O
more O
convenient O
PUNCT O
even O
though O
it O
's O
about O
20 O
inch O
thicker O
and O
2 O
lbs O
heavier O
PUNCT O

at O
home O
and O
the O
office O
it O
gets O
plugged O
into O
an O
external B-NEU
24" I-NEU
lcd I-NEU
screen E-NEU
PUNCT O
so O
built B-NEU
in I-NEU
screen I-NEU
size E-NEU
is O
not O
terribly O
important O
PUNCT O

hopefully O
my O
replacement O
is O
brand O
new O
PUNCT O

just O
beware O
no O
dvd B-NEU
slot E-NEU
so O
when O
i O
went O
to O
install B-NEG
software E-NEG
i O
had O
on O
cd O
i O
could O
n't O
PUNCT O

i O
bought O
it O
to O
be O
able O
to O
dedicate O
a O
small O
PUNCT O
portable O
laptop O
to O
my O
writing O
and O
was O
surprised O
to O
learn O
that O
i O
needed O
to O
buy O
a O
word B-NEU
processing I-NEU
program E-NEU
to O
do O
so O
PUNCT O

this O
version O
of O
macbook O
pro O
runs O
on O
a O
third-generation B-NEU
cpu I-NEU
("ivy I-NEU
bridge") E-NEU
PUNCT O
not O
the O
latest O
fourth-generation B-NEU
haswell I-NEU
cpu E-NEU
the O
2013 O
version O
has O
PUNCT O

actually O
PUNCT O
i O
think O
i O
was O
intimidated O
by O
the O
change O
from O
a O
pc O
PUNCT O

no O
cd B-NEU
rom E-NEU
in O
the O
new O
version O
there O
's O
no O
way O
i O
'm O
spending O
that O
kind O
of O
money O
on O
something O
has O
less O
features S-NEG
than O
the O
older O
version O
PUNCT O

definitely O
worth O
spending O
the O
money O
on O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
have O
three O
words O
PUNCT O
piece O
of O
junk O
PUNCT O

the O
volume S-NEG
is O
really O
low O
to O
low O
for O
a O
laptopwas O
not O
expectin O
t O
volume S-NEG
to O
be O
so O
lowan O
i O
hate O
that O
about O
this O
computer O

fits O
all O
my O
personal O
needs O
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
the O
pro-active O
type O
so O
i O
went O
off O
and O
did O
some O
preventative O
fixes O
PUNCT O

and O
its O
not O
hard O
to O
accidentally O
bang O
it O
against O
something O
so O
i O
recommend O
getting O
a O
case S-NEU
to O
protect O
it O
PUNCT O

i O
wanted O
to O
explore O
what O
the O
mac O
was O
all O
about O
PUNCT O

i O
got O
this O
at O
an O
amazing O
price S-POS
from O
amazon O
and O
it O
arrived O
just O
in O
time O
PUNCT O

every O
time O
i O
log B-NEG
into I-NEG
the I-NEG
system E-NEG
after O
a O
few O
hours O
PUNCT O
there O
is O
this O
endlessly O
frustrating O
process O
that O
i O
have O
to O
go O
through O
PUNCT O

the O
majority O
of O
the O
reviews O
seem O
to O
be O
for O
the O
133 O
macbook O
pro O
model O
PUNCT O
md101ll/a O
PUNCT O

put O
a O
ssd S-NEU
and O
use O
a O
21" B-NEU
led I-NEU
screen E-NEU
PUNCT O
this O
set B-POS
up E-POS
is O
silky O
smooth O
PUNCT O

i O
saw O
the O
bad O
reviews O
from O
people O
saying O
to O
buy O
directly O
from O
apple O
and O
i O
was O
concerned O
but O
i O
took O
my O
chances O
and O
am O
overly O
impressed O
PUNCT O

the O
case S-NEG
is O
now O
slightly O
larger O
than O
the O
previous O
generation O
PUNCT O
but O
the O
lack O
of O
an O
external B-NEU
power I-NEU
supply E-NEU
justifies O
the O
small O
increase O
in O
size O
PUNCT O

i O
had O
to O
buy O
a O
wireless B-NEU
mouse E-NEU
to O
go O
with O
it O
PUNCT O
as O
i O
am O
old O
school O
and O
hate O
the O
pad S-NEG
PUNCT O
but O
knew O
that O
before O
i O
bought O
it O
PUNCT O
now O
it O
works S-POS
great O
PUNCT O
need O
to O
get O
adjusted O
to O
the O
key B-NEU
board E-NEU
PUNCT O
as O
i O
am O
used O
to O
a O
bigger O
one O
and O
pounding O
PUNCT O

when O
considering O
a O
mac O
PUNCT O
look O
at O
the O
total O
cost B-NEU
of I-NEU
ownership E-NEU
and O
not O
just O
the O
initial O
price B-NEU
tag E-NEU
PUNCT O

has O
all O
the O
other O
features S-POS
i O
wanted O
including O
a O
vga B-NEU
port E-NEU
PUNCT O
hdmi S-NEU
PUNCT O
ethernet S-NEU
and O
3 O
usb B-NEU
ports E-NEU
PUNCT O

a O
great O
college O
tool O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
dislike O
about O
this O
laptop O
are O
the O
rubber B-NEG
pads E-NEG
found O
on O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
computer O
for O
grip O
PUNCT O

i O
called O
apple O
and O
no O
solution O
PUNCT O

it O
's O
a O
decent O
computer O
for O
the O
price S-NEU
and O
hopefully O
it O
will O
last O
a O
long O
time O
PUNCT O

i O
was O
really O
happy O
because O
it O
is O
a O
much O
better O
price O
on O
amazoncom O
than O
it O
was O
in O
the O
mac O
store O
PUNCT O

the O
worst O
a O
mac O
ever O
did O
to O
me O
was O
freeze O
up O
PUNCT O

the O
nicest O
part O
is O
the O
low O
heat B-POS
output E-POS
and O
ultra O
quiet O
operation S-POS
PUNCT O

i O
am O
paying O
apple O
to O
kill O
my O
self O
and O
my O
wallet O
PUNCT O

no O
star O
for O
this O
trash O
PUNCT O
PUNCT O

i O
will O
upgrade B-POS
the I-POS
ram E-POS
myself O
because O
with O
this O
model O
you O
can O
you O
can O
do O
it O
later O
on O
PUNCT O

the O
price S-POS
is O
200 O
dollars O
down O
PUNCT O

this O
mac O
mini O
does O
not O
have O
a O
built-in B-NEU
mic E-NEU
PUNCT O
and O
it O
would O
seem O
that O
its O
mac B-NEG
os I-NEG
10.9 E-NEG
does O
not O
handle O
external B-NEU
microphones E-NEU
properly O
PUNCT O

a O
lot O
of O
features S-NEU
and O
shortcuts S-NEU
on O
the O
mbp O
that O
i O
was O
never O
exposed O
to O
on O
a O
normal O
pc O
PUNCT O

was O
n't O
sure O
if O
i O
was O
going O
to O
like O
it O
much O
less O
love O
it O
so O
i O
went O
to O
a O
local O
best O
buy O
and O
played O
around O
with O
the O
ios B-POS
system E-POS
on O
a O
mac O
pro O
and O
it O
was O
totally O
unique O
and O
different O
PUNCT O

quietest O
laptop O
i O
have O
ever O
owned O
PUNCT O

air O
has O
higher O
resolution S-POS
but O
the O
fonts S-NEG
are O
small O
PUNCT O

again O
this O
is O
just O
my O
personal O
honest O
opinion O
PUNCT O

if O
you O
have O
much O
higher O
expectations O
than O
that O
i O
would O
look O
elsewhere O
PUNCT O

working S-POS
with O
mac O
is O
so O
much O
easier O
PUNCT O
so O
many O
cool O
features S-POS
PUNCT O

i O
'm O
going O
to O
buy O
a O
logitevh O
c270 O
PUNCT O

very O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase O
PUNCT O

i O
like O
the O
brightness S-POS
and O

PUNCT O

i O
'm O
so O
happy O
with O
my O
macbook O

PUNCT O

i O
only O
wish O
this O
mac O
had O
a O
cd/dvd B-NEU
player E-NEU
built O
in O
PUNCT O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
miss O
is O
that O
my O
old O
alienware O
laptop O
had O
backlit B-NEG
keys E-NEG
PUNCT O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
miss O
are O
the O
"home/end" B-NEU
type I-NEU
keys E-NEU
and O
other O
things O
that O
i O
grew O
accustomed O
to O
after O
so O
long O
PUNCT O

so O
happy O
with O
this O
purchase O
PUNCT O
i O
just O
wish O
it O
came O
with O
microsoft B-NEU
word E-NEU
PUNCT O

it O
is O
more O
than O
enough O
computer O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
the O

of O
a O
high O

student O
PUNCT O

it O
has O
enough O
memory S-POS
and O
speed S-POS
to O
run O
my O
business O
with O
all O
the O
flexibility S-POS
that O
comes O
with O
a O

PUNCT O

the O

PUNCT O
the O

PUNCT O

i O
love O
everything O
about O
this O
computer O
PUNCT O

i O
found O
it O
toughest O
to O
decide O
between O
dell O
ultra O
books O

apple O
PUNCT O

the O
battery B-POS
life E-POS
is O
excellent O
PUNCT O
the O

excellent O
PUNCT O
and O
downloading B-POS

is O
a O

PUNCT O

the O

PUNCT O
the O

the O

PUNCT O

while O
we O
struggle O
with O
all O
the O
crashes O

PUNCT O
the O
kids O

stay O
consistent O

so O
we O
caved O
in O

bought O
one O
for O
buisness O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
n't O
want O
to O

PUNCT O
i O
want O
to O
use O

PUNCT O

i O
have O
dropped O

a O
couple O
times O
with O

a O
slim B-NEU
plastic I-NEU

i O
also O
made O
a O

PUNCT O

being O

user O
for O
many O
years O
to O
switch O

i O
will O
not O
go O
back O
PUNCT O

but O
with O
this O
laptop O
PUNCT O
the O
bass S-NEG
is O
very O
weak O
and O
the O
sound S-NEG
comes O
out O
sound S-NEG
tinny O
PUNCT O

i O
do O
admit O
it O
is O
pricey O
but O
the O
saying O
is O
really O
true O
with O
this O
macbook O
pro O
laptop O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
PUNCT O

i O
've O
almost O
have O

also O

further O
PUNCT O
this O
mac O
